This formula is a QUERY function, which is primarily used in Google Sheets. It's not a native Excel formula, nor is it related to Power Query in Excel. Let me break it down for you:

1. Type of formula: This is a QUERY function, which uses a SQL-like syntax to manipulate and retrieve data from a range in Google Sheets.

2. Learning QUERY syntax:
   - Google Sheets Documentation: Google provides comprehensive documentation on the QUERY function.
   - Online tutorials: Many websites offer tutorials specifically for Google Sheets QUERY function.
   - Practice: Start with simple queries and gradually increase complexity.

3. Is this Power Query?
   No, this is not Power Query. Power Query is a data transformation and preparation tool in Excel. While both can manipulate data, they are different tools:
   - QUERY function is specific to Google Sheets
   - Power Query is specific to Excel

To learn more about using QUERY in Google Sheets, I'd recommend starting with Google's official documentation and then practicing with your own data. The syntax is similar to SQL, so if you're familiar with SQL, you'll find some similarities.
