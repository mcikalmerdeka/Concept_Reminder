example : fast create a new text file
%%writefile test.txt
Hello, this is a quick test file.
This is the second line of the file.

%%writefile -a test.txt
This is more text being appended to test.txt
And another line here.

explanation:

The approach you're using with `%%writefile` is called a "magic command" or "IPython magic". This specific command is part of IPython, which is an interactive Python shell, and is commonly used in Jupyter Notebooks.

The `%%` at the beginning indicates that this is a cell magic command, which operates on the entire cell rather than just a single line.

As for other uses of the `%%` formatting, it's important to note that this isn't Python syntax per se, but rather a feature of IPython/Jupyter. Here are some other common cell magics that use the `%%` prefix:

1. `%%time`: Time the execution of the entire cell.

2. `%%timeit`: Run a cell multiple times to get more accurate timing.

3. `%%html`: Render the cell contents as HTML.

4. `%%javascript`: Run the cell contents as JavaScript.

5. `%%latex`: Render the cell contents as LaTeX.

6. `%%sh` or `%%bash`: Run the cell contents as a shell script.

7. `%%sql`: Run SQL commands (requires appropriate extensions).

8. `%%matplotlib inline`: Set up matplotlib to work interactively in the notebook.

9. `%%cython`: Compile and run Cython code.

10. `%%capture`: Capture the output of the cell (stdout/stderr) for later use.

These magic commands are specific to the IPython environment and won't work in a standard Python script or interpreter. They're designed to enhance the interactive coding experience, particularly in Jupyter Notebooks.

To see a full list of available magic commands in your IPython environment, you can run the following command:

```python
%lsmagic
```

This will show you both line magics (starting with `%`) and cell magics (starting with `%%`) that are available in your current environment.

Remember, while these magic commands are powerful tools in interactive environments, they're not part of standard Python syntax and won't work outside of IPython/Jupyter contexts.
