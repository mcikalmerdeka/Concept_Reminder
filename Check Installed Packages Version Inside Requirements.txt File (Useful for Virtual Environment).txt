is this how i see all the installed packages version in my requirements.txt file

pip showGet-Content .\requirements.txt | ForEach-Object { pip show $_ | Select-Object Name,Version }

Your command has a syntax issue. Here's the correct way to list the installed package versions based on the packages in your `requirements.txt` file:

### Correct Command (PowerShell)
```powershell
Get-Content .\requirements.txt | ForEach-Object { pip show $_ } | Select-String "Name|Version"
```

### Explanation:
- `Get-Content .\requirements.txt`: Reads the `requirements.txt` file line by line.
- `ForEach-Object { pip show $_ }`: Runs `pip show` on each package.
- `Select-String "Name|Version"`: Filters the output to show only lines containing "Name" or "Version".

### Alternative Approach (Python)
If you prefer a Python solution:
```python
import pkg_resources

with open("requirements.txt") as f:
    packages = f.read().splitlines()

for package in packages:
    try:
        version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(package).version
        print(f"{package}=={version}")
    except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:
        print(f"{package} is not installed")
```

This ensures you get the installed version of each package in your `requirements.txt` file. ðŸš€
