if i want to update my pgAdmin application from the current installed version of 7.6 to the newest version which is pgAdmin 4 v9.0 (released Feb. 6, 2025), does all of the created databases will be deleted after i installed that new version? the postgreSQL version that i am using is postgresSQL 16 and i am not changing that

Upgrading **pgAdmin** from version 7.6 to **pgAdmin 4 v9.0** will **not delete your PostgreSQL databases**. Here's why and what you need to know:

---

### 1. **Your Databases Are Safe**
   - PostgreSQL databases are stored and managed by the **PostgreSQL server** (v16 in your case), **not** by pgAdmin.  
   - pgAdmin is **only a client tool** to interact with your PostgreSQL server. Updating/uninstalling pgAdmin does not affect the server or its data.

---

### 2. **What Might Be Affected?**
   - **pgAdmin-Specific Data**: Saved server connections, query history, or dashboard settings in pgAdmin *might* be reset if the upgrade process involves removing the old version.  
     - To preserve these, back up your pgAdmin configuration files before upgrading (see steps below).

---

### 3. **How to Safely Upgrade**
   1. **Backup pgAdmin Configurations** (Optional but Recommended):  
      - **Windows**: Copy `%APPDATA%\pgAdmin`  
      - **Linux/macOS**: Copy `~/.pgadmin/`  
      *(This saves server connections, settings, etc.)*
   
   2. **Install the New pgAdmin 4 v9.0**:  
      - Follow the [official pgAdmin upgrade guide](https://www.pgadmin.org/faq/).  
      - Most installers will preserve or migrate existing settings automatically, but check release notes for v9.0 to confirm.

   3. **Verify PostgreSQL Server Connections**:  
      - After upgrading, reconfigure any server connections in pgAdmin if needed (use your PostgreSQL credentials).  
      - Your databases will still exist on the PostgreSQL server (v16).

---

### 4. **PostgreSQL Server Remains Unchanged**
   - Since you’re not upgrading PostgreSQL (v16 stays intact), your databases, users, and configurations on the server are **untouched**.

---

### Key Takeaway
Your databases are **not at risk** during a pgAdmin upgrade. Focus on backing up pgAdmin settings if you want to retain connections/history. The PostgreSQL server and its data remain fully independent.

do i need to uninstall the current version first or i could just direcly install the newest version and it will automatically migrate the data?


For most pgAdmin upgrades (including moving from **pgAdmin 7.6 to pgAdmin 4 v9.0**), you **do not need to uninstall the old version first**. Here’s what you should know:

---

### **1. Direct Installation (Recommended)**
   - **Install the new version over the old one**:  
     - Most pgAdmin installers (Windows, macOS, Linux) will automatically replace the old version and migrate existing configurations (saved connections, settings, etc.).  
     - Your PostgreSQL server connections and query history are stored in **user-specific configuration files** (e.g., `%APPDATA%\pgAdmin` on Windows or `~/.pgadmin/` on Linux/macOS), which are preserved during the upgrade.

   - **Exception**: If the pgAdmin documentation for v9.0 explicitly states that a clean install is required, follow those instructions. Check the [release notes](https://www.pgadmin.org/news/) for v9.0 before proceeding.

---

### **2. When to Uninstall First**
   - **Only if the installer fails** (e.g., conflicts between old/new versions).  
   - **Clean install preference**: If you want to avoid potential conflicts (rare), manually uninstall pgAdmin 7.6 first. Your configuration files will remain intact unless you delete them explicitly.

---

### **3. Steps to Upgrade Safely**
1. **Backup pgAdmin Configurations** (Optional but Safe):  
   - Copy the pgAdmin config folder (e.g., `%APPDATA%\pgAdmin` on Windows or `~/.pgadmin/` on Linux/macOS) to a safe location.  
   *(This ensures you can restore settings if anything goes wrong.)*

2. **Install pgAdmin 4 v9.0**:  
   - Download the new version from [pgAdmin.org](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).  
   - Run the installer. It will typically detect and replace the old version.

3. **Verify After Installation**:  
   - Open pgAdmin 4 v9.0 and confirm your saved server connections, dashboards, and settings are intact.  
   - Re-link any missing servers using your PostgreSQL v16 credentials (your databases are untouched).

---

### **4. PostgreSQL Server Remains Unaffected**
   - Your PostgreSQL v16 server and databases are separate from pgAdmin. They will **not** be modified or deleted during the pgAdmin upgrade.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **No uninstall needed**: Install pgAdmin 4 v9.0 directly over v7.6.  
- **Configurations are preserved**: Settings are stored in user folders, not the installation directory.  
- **Backup configs**: Optional but recommended for critical setups.  

If you’re unsure, check the **pgAdmin v9.0 release notes** for upgrade instructions specific to that version.
