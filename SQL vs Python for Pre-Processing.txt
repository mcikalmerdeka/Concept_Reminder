The choice between using SQL or Python for data cleaning and exploration depends on various factors, including the nature of your data, your familiarity with the tools, and the specific tasks you need to perform. Both SQL and Python are powerful tools with their own strengths, and often they are used together in a complementary fashion. Here are some considerations for each:

**Using SQL:**

1. **Structured Data**: SQL is particularly well-suited for working with structured data stored in relational databases. If your data is already in a database, using SQL can be efficient and fast.

2. **Data Aggregation**: SQL is excellent for aggregating and summarizing data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc. It's great for answering questions about your data at a high level.

3. **Database Operations**: SQL is optimized for database operations like filtering, sorting, and joining tables. If your data resides in a relational database, using SQL can be more efficient than pulling the data into Python.

4. **Parallel Processing**: In some cases, databases can take advantage of parallel processing for improved performance when dealing with large datasets.

**Using Python:**

1. **Versatility**: Python is a general-purpose programming language and is more versatile than SQL. You can use it for data cleaning, exploration, analysis, visualization, and more. It's not limited to working with databases.

2. **Data Cleaning Libraries**: Python has powerful libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning. It provides a wide range of functions for handling missing data, filtering, merging, and transforming datasets.

3. **Data Visualization**: Libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly make it easy to create detailed and customized visualizations, helping you gain insights into your data.

4. **Machine Learning Integration**: If you're planning to perform machine learning or advanced analytics, Python is a more natural choice. Libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow are widely used for these tasks.

5. **Integration with Other Tools**: Python can easily integrate with various data sources, APIs, and other tools, making it flexible for diverse data scenarios.

**Combining SQL and Python:**

In many real-world scenarios, a combination of both SQL and Python is used. SQL can be used for initial data extraction, aggregation, and filtering, and then Python can be employed for more complex data cleaning, exploration, and analysis tasks.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific needs, preferences, and the characteristics of your data. Many data professionals find it beneficial to be proficient in both SQL and Python to leverage the strengths of each tool appropriately.
