**Data governance** and **data management** are closely related concepts, but they focus on different aspects of handling data within an organization.

### Data Governance:
Data governance is a high-level framework that defines how data is managed, controlled, and protected within an organization. It encompasses the policies, procedures, and standards that ensure data is accurate, secure, and used responsibly.

**Key Components of Data Governance:**
1. **Data Policies:** Guidelines and rules that dictate how data should be managed and used.
2. **Data Stewardship:** Assigning roles and responsibilities to individuals or teams to oversee data management practices.
3. **Data Quality Management:** Ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and reliability.
4. **Data Security:** Protecting data from unauthorized access and breaches.
5. **Compliance:** Ensuring data practices comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards.
6. **Data Lifecycle Management:** Managing data from creation to disposal, including archiving and deletion.

**Objectives of Data Governance:**
- Ensure data integrity and accuracy.
- Protect data privacy and security.
- Improve data accessibility and usability.
- Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
- Enhance decision-making through reliable data.

### Data Management:
Data management is the practical implementation of data governance policies and involves the processes and technologies used to collect, store, organize, and maintain data.

**Key Components of Data Management:**
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering data from various sources.
2. **Data Storage:** Storing data in databases, data warehouses, data lakes, etc.
3. **Data Integration:** Combining data from different sources to provide a unified view.
4. **Data Processing:** Transforming raw data into a usable format through cleaning, validation, and enrichment.
5. **Data Maintenance:** Regularly updating and maintaining data to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
6. **Data Access and Retrieval:** Providing tools and mechanisms for users to access and retrieve data.
7. **Data Backup and Recovery:** Ensuring data is backed up and can be recovered in case of loss or corruption.
8. **Data Analytics:** Using tools and techniques to analyze data for insights and decision-making.

**Objectives of Data Management:**
- Efficiently handle large volumes of data.
- Ensure data is readily available and accessible.
- Maintain data accuracy and consistency.
- Support data-driven decision-making processes.
- Optimize data storage and retrieval processes.

### Relationship Between Data Governance and Data Management:
- **Data governance** sets the policies, standards, and guidelines for data handling.
- **Data management** implements these policies and standards through practical processes and technologies.

### Example:
- **Data Governance:** An organization implements a policy that all customer data must be encrypted and only accessible by authorized personnel.
- **Data Management:** The IT team uses specific encryption software to encrypt the data and sets up access controls to ensure only authorized users can access it.

In summary, data governance provides the strategic oversight and framework for data usage, while data management focuses on the operational execution of these strategies to ensure data is effectively managed and utilized.
