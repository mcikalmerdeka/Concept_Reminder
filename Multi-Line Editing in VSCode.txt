In Visual Studio Code (VSCode), there are multiple ways to select and edit multiple lines efficiently:

### 1. **Using `Alt` (or `Option` on macOS) and Drag**:
   - Hold `Alt` (`Option` on macOS) and drag your mouse over the lines you want to select. This creates a **block (column) selection**.
   - Once selected, type to edit all selected lines simultaneously.

### 2. **Using `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) + `Alt` + Down/Up Arrow**:
   - Place your cursor on the first line.
   - Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + Down Arrow (`Cmd` + `Option` + Down Arrow on macOS) to add cursors on the lines below.
   - Use `Up Arrow` to add cursors on the lines above.

---

### 3. **Shift + Alt + Arrow Keys**:
   - Hold `Shift` + `Alt` (`Shift` + `Option` on macOS) and use the arrow keys to extend a block selection.
   - This works well for selecting parts of multiple lines.

### 4. **Selecting All Instances of a Word (Multi-Cursor Editing)**:
   - Select the word you want to edit.
   - Press `Ctrl` + `D` (`Cmd` + `D` on macOS) to add a cursor at the next instance of the same word.
   - Keep pressing `Ctrl` + `D` until all instances are selected.
   - Edit all selected words simultaneously.

### 5. **Ctrl + Shift + L (Select All Matching Text)**:
   - Highlight a word or block of text.
   - Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `L` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `L` on macOS) to select all matching occurrences in the file.
   - All selected instances will now have cursors for simultaneous editing.

---

### 6. **Mouse and Keyboard Combination**:
   - Hold `Ctrl` (`Cmd` on macOS) and click at different locations where you want to add a cursor.
   - Once all cursors are added, type to edit multiple lines.

These techniques are very powerful for making quick edits in VSCode across multiple lines or instances.
