A good foldering structure for a data science project should be organized and modular, ensuring ease of navigation and clarity for you and other collaborators. Based on your project, which includes analysis, modeling, and a Streamlit app, here's a recommended folder structure:

```
project/
│
├── data/                # Raw and processed datasets
│   ├── raw/             # Original/raw data files
│   ├── processed/       # Processed/cleaned data files
│
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling
│   └── analysis.ipynb   # Your analysis and modeling notebook
│
├── models/              # Saved models
│   └── model.pkl        # Example: Pickle file for your trained model
│
├── scripts/             # Python scripts for app or reusable functions
│   ├── app.py           # Your Streamlit app
│   ├── utils.py         # Helper functions (if any)
│
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies for the project
├── README.md            # Overview and instructions for the project
├── .gitignore           # To exclude unnecessary files from version control
│
└── tests/               # Unit or integration tests for your scripts
```

### Explanation of Each Folder/File:
1. **`data/`**: 
   - Contains all datasets used in the project. 
   - Keeping raw and processed data separate ensures raw data remains unaltered.

2. **`notebooks/`**:
   - Stores Jupyter notebooks, categorized by purpose (e.g., analysis, experiments, etc.).
   - Naming them descriptively (e.g., `analysis.ipynb`) helps others understand their purpose.

3. **`models/`**:
   - Saves serialized models (e.g., `.pkl`, `.h5`, etc.).
   - Keeping models in a dedicated folder ensures versioning and tracking are easier.

4. **`scripts/`**:
   - Contains Python scripts for your Streamlit app or reusable utilities like preprocessing functions.

5. **`requirements.txt`**:
   - Lists all Python libraries required to run the project, which can be generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

6. **`README.md`**:
   - Provides an overview of the project, instructions on setup, and how to run the app.

7. **`.gitignore`**:
   - Excludes temporary files, datasets, and other unnecessary files from Git version control.

8. **`tests/`**:
   - Helps ensure your codebase works as expected by adding tests for your app and functions.

This structure is scalable and maintains a clear separation of concerns, making collaboration and long-term maintenance easier.

if i want to name the folder of analysis to analysis since i have other files like exported figures from EDA, is that recommended?

Yes, renaming the folder to **`analysis/`** and including related files like exported figures from EDA is a good idea. This approach keeps all analysis-related materials in one place, making your project more organized. Here's how the updated structure might look:

```
project/
│
├── data/                # Raw and processed datasets
│   ├── raw/             # Original/raw data files
│   ├── processed/       # Processed/cleaned data files
│
├── analysis/            # All analysis and modeling-related files
│   ├── analysis.ipynb   # Your analysis and modeling notebook
│   ├── figures/         # Exported figures from EDA or visualizations
│   └── results/         # Outputs from modeling (e.g., metrics, reports)
│
├── models/              # Saved models
│   └── model.pkl        # Example: Pickle file for your trained model
│
├── scripts/             # Python scripts for app or reusable functions
│   ├── app.py           # Your Streamlit app
│   ├── utils.py         # Helper functions (if any)
│
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies for the project
├── README.md            # Overview and instructions for the project
├── .gitignore           # To exclude unnecessary files from version control
│
└── tests/               # Unit or integration tests for your scripts
```

### Why This Works Well:
1. **Clarity**: 
   - By naming the folder `analysis/`, you signal that it contains all files related to exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

2. **Grouping Related Files**: 
   - Keeping notebooks, figures, and modeling results together avoids scattering related materials across the project.

3. **Scalability**:
   - If your project grows, you can add subfolders within `analysis/` (e.g., `figures/`, `results/`) for better organization.

### Subfolder Recommendations in `analysis/`:
- **`figures/`**: 
  Store all static visualizations, plots, or images exported from your analysis.
  
- **`results/`**: 
  Save intermediate results, such as metrics, reports, or CSV files summarizing insights.

This structure ensures everything analysis-related is easy to locate while maintaining a clean and professional project layout.

but how do i access it now that it doesn't contained in one folder, like i believe i cant run it like this anymore right?

# Read from local
df = pd.read_csv('Training Data.csv')

You're correct that once files are organized into separate folders, you need to adjust the paths when accessing them. Here's how you can manage and access files stored in subfolders:

### Accessing Files in Subfolders
To access a file in a subfolder, you need to provide the relative path from your current working directory. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Read the CSV from the data/raw folder
df = pd.read_csv('data/raw/Training Data.csv')

# Load the scaler from the models folder
scaler = joblib.load('models/scaler.joblib')
```

### Ensuring Correct Paths with `os` or `pathlib`
If your project structure grows, hardcoding paths can become cumbersome. To make it more robust, use Python's `os` or `pathlib` modules to dynamically construct paths.

#### Using `os`:
```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Define the base directory (e.g., project root)
base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Construct file paths
data_path = os.path.join(base_dir, 'data', 'raw', 'Training Data.csv')
scaler_path = os.path.join(base_dir, 'models', 'scaler.joblib')

# Read data and load scaler
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
scaler = joblib.load(scaler_path)
```

#### Using `pathlib` (Preferred in Modern Python):
```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Define the base directory
base_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent

# Construct file paths
data_path = base_dir / 'data' / 'raw' / 'Training Data.csv'
scaler_path = base_dir / 'models' / 'scaler.joblib'

# Read data and load scaler
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
scaler = joblib.load(scaler_path)
```

### Why This is Better
- **Flexibility**: Paths are dynamically constructed based on your project’s structure, reducing errors if you move files or folders.
- **Portability**: The code works on different operating systems, as `os` and `pathlib` handle path separators (`/` vs. `\`) automatically.

By adopting one of these approaches, you can easily access files in separate folders while maintaining a clean and organized project structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

when i want to check the base dir i got this error, help me fix it

# Define the base directory (e.g., project root)
base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
print('Base directory : ', base_dir)

The error occurs because `__file__` is not defined in interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks or when running code directly in a REPL. The `__file__` attribute is available only in Python scripts. Here's how you can resolve the issue:

### Solution for Interactive Environments
When using Jupyter notebooks or interactive environments, you can get the current working directory (which acts as the base directory) using `os.getcwd()` or `Path.cwd()`:

#### Using `os`:
```python
import os

# Get the current working directory
base_dir = os.getcwd()
print('Base directory:', base_dir)
```

#### Using `pathlib`:
```python
from pathlib import Path

# Get the current working directory
base_dir = Path.cwd()
print('Base directory:', base_dir)
```

### Adjusting Paths
After determining the base directory, you can construct paths relative to it:
```python
data_path = os.path.join(base_dir, 'data', 'raw', 'Training Data.csv')
scaler_path = os.path.join(base_dir, 'models', 'scaler.joblib')

# Or using pathlib
data_path = base_dir / 'data' / 'raw' / 'Training Data.csv'
scaler_path = base_dir / 'models' / 'scaler.joblib'
```

### For Python Scripts
If you move your code to a Python script file (`.py`), `__file__` will work as expected:
```python
import os

# Get the directory of the current script
base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
print('Base directory:', base_dir)
```

### Recap
- **Interactive environments (e.g., Jupyter):** Use `os.getcwd()` or `Path.cwd()`.
- **Python scripts:** Use `__file__` for the script's directory.

This ensures your code works across both development setups seamlessly!

but remember that the training data is in the data folder right and this jupyter notebook file is in analysis folder, how can i access them while i want to start working form the parent directory which is this

E:\Personal Projects\Loan Prediction Based on Costumer Behaviour\Loan-Prediction-Based-on-Costumer-Behaviour

If your working directory is the parent folder (`E:\Personal Projects\Loan Prediction Based on Costumer Behaviour\Loan-Prediction-Based-on-Costumer-Behaviour`), you can construct paths relative to that directory to access files in subfolders like `data` and `analysis`.

### Setting Up Relative Paths
Since you are working from the **parent directory**, construct the paths as follows:

1. **Accessing `Training Data.csv` in the `data/raw/` folder**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Construct the path relative to the parent directory
   data_path = 'data/raw/Training Data.csv'
   df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
   ```

2. **Saving or loading files in/from the `models` folder**:
   ```python
   import joblib

   # Path to the scaler file
   scaler_path = 'models/scaler.joblib'
   scaler = joblib.load(scaler_path)
   ```

3. **Using Pathlib for Robustness**:
   ```python
   from pathlib import Path

   # Define paths using Pathlib
   base_dir = Path('E:/Personal Projects/Loan Prediction Based on Costumer Behaviour/Loan-Prediction-Based-on-Costumer-Behaviour')
   data_path = base_dir / 'data' / 'raw' / 'Training Data.csv'
   scaler_path = base_dir / 'models' / 'scaler.joblib'

   # Load the data and scaler
   df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
   scaler = joblib.load(scaler_path)
   ```

### Automatically Set Parent Directory as Working Directory
If you're working in a Jupyter notebook and want to ensure the working directory is always the parent directory, you can use the following at the start of your notebook:

1. **Change to Parent Directory**:
   ```python
   import os

   # Change the working directory to the parent directory
   parent_dir = r"E:\Personal Projects\Loan Prediction Based on Costumer Behaviour\Loan-Prediction-Based-on-Costumer-Behaviour"
   os.chdir(parent_dir)
   print("Current working directory:", os.getcwd())
   ```

2. **Access Files Using Relative Paths**:
   After setting the parent directory as the working directory, you can use relative paths as described earlier:
   ```python
   # Access the training data
   df = pd.read_csv('data/raw/Training Data.csv')

   # Access the scaler
   scaler = joblib.load('models/scaler.joblib')
   ```

### Why This Works
- By setting the parent directory as the working directory (`os.chdir()`), all relative paths (`data/...`, `models/...`) will be resolved correctly from that directory.
- This approach avoids hardcoding paths, making your project portable and easier to manage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: THIS APPROACH WORKS (can be used for load other things also)

One potential issue to watch out for: changing directories with os.chdir() can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in notebooks or scripts. An alternative approach could be:

# Get absolute path to the parent directory without changing current directory
parent_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), os.pardir))
data_path = os.path.join(parent_dir, 'data', 'Training Data.csv')

try:
    df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File not found at {data_path}")

This second approach avoids changing the working directory while achieving the same goal. Choose the approach that better fits your specific use case.
