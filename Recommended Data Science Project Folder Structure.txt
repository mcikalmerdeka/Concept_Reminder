A good foldering structure for a data science project should be organized and modular, ensuring ease of navigation and clarity for you and other collaborators. Based on your project, which includes analysis, modeling, and a Streamlit app, here's a recommended folder structure:

```
project/
│
├── data/                # Raw and processed datasets
│   ├── raw/             # Original/raw data files
│   ├── processed/       # Processed/cleaned data files
│
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling
│   └── analysis.ipynb   # Your analysis and modeling notebook
│
├── models/              # Saved models
│   └── model.pkl        # Example: Pickle file for your trained model
│
├── scripts/             # Python scripts for app or reusable functions
│   ├── app.py           # Your Streamlit app
│   ├── utils.py         # Helper functions (if any)
│
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies for the project
├── README.md            # Overview and instructions for the project
├── .gitignore           # To exclude unnecessary files from version control
│
└── tests/               # Unit or integration tests for your scripts
```

### Explanation of Each Folder/File:
1. **`data/`**: 
   - Contains all datasets used in the project. 
   - Keeping raw and processed data separate ensures raw data remains unaltered.

2. **`notebooks/`**:
   - Stores Jupyter notebooks, categorized by purpose (e.g., analysis, experiments, etc.).
   - Naming them descriptively (e.g., `analysis.ipynb`) helps others understand their purpose.

3. **`models/`**:
   - Saves serialized models (e.g., `.pkl`, `.h5`, etc.).
   - Keeping models in a dedicated folder ensures versioning and tracking are easier.

4. **`scripts/`**:
   - Contains Python scripts for your Streamlit app or reusable utilities like preprocessing functions.

5. **`requirements.txt`**:
   - Lists all Python libraries required to run the project, which can be generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

6. **`README.md`**:
   - Provides an overview of the project, instructions on setup, and how to run the app.

7. **`.gitignore`**:
   - Excludes temporary files, datasets, and other unnecessary files from Git version control.

8. **`tests/`**:
   - Helps ensure your codebase works as expected by adding tests for your app and functions.

This structure is scalable and maintains a clear separation of concerns, making collaboration and long-term maintenance easier.

if i want to name the folder of analysis to analysis since i have other files like exported figures from EDA, is that recommended?

Yes, renaming the folder to **`analysis/`** and including related files like exported figures from EDA is a good idea. This approach keeps all analysis-related materials in one place, making your project more organized. Here's how the updated structure might look:

```
project/
│
├── data/                # Raw and processed datasets
│   ├── raw/             # Original/raw data files
│   ├── processed/       # Processed/cleaned data files
│
├── analysis/            # All analysis and modeling-related files
│   ├── analysis.ipynb   # Your analysis and modeling notebook
│   ├── figures/         # Exported figures from EDA or visualizations
│   └── results/         # Outputs from modeling (e.g., metrics, reports)
│
├── models/              # Saved models
│   └── model.pkl        # Example: Pickle file for your trained model
│
├── scripts/             # Python scripts for app or reusable functions
│   ├── app.py           # Your Streamlit app
│   ├── utils.py         # Helper functions (if any)
│
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies for the project
├── README.md            # Overview and instructions for the project
├── .gitignore           # To exclude unnecessary files from version control
│
└── tests/               # Unit or integration tests for your scripts
```

### Why This Works Well:
1. **Clarity**: 
   - By naming the folder `analysis/`, you signal that it contains all files related to exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

2. **Grouping Related Files**: 
   - Keeping notebooks, figures, and modeling results together avoids scattering related materials across the project.

3. **Scalability**:
   - If your project grows, you can add subfolders within `analysis/` (e.g., `figures/`, `results/`) for better organization.

### Subfolder Recommendations in `analysis/`:
- **`figures/`**: 
  Store all static visualizations, plots, or images exported from your analysis.
  
- **`results/`**: 
  Save intermediate results, such as metrics, reports, or CSV files summarizing insights.

This structure ensures everything analysis-related is easy to locate while maintaining a clean and professional project layout.
