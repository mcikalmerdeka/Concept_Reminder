if i installed postgresql, and to access it i am using pgAdmin4 and using dbeaver. but i am curious about something, like where does the data actually stored? it's not stored in the pgAdmin and dbeaver right?

Correct, the data is not stored in **pgAdmin 4** or **DBeaver**. These tools are client applications used to connect to and manage a PostgreSQL database server. The actual data is stored in the PostgreSQL database server itself, which resides on the host machine where PostgreSQL is installed.

Here’s how it works:

### **Where PostgreSQL Stores Data**
1. **Data Directory (Data Folder)**:
   - PostgreSQL stores its data in a specific directory on the server machine, commonly referred to as the **data directory**. 
   - The location of this directory is defined during the installation of PostgreSQL. On many systems, it is located in paths like:
     - **Linux**: `/var/lib/postgresql/<version>/main/` or `/var/lib/pgsql/<version>/data/`
     - **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\`
   - This directory contains all the data files, configuration files, and logs for the PostgreSQL database.

2. **PostgreSQL Data Structure**:
   - The data itself is stored in binary files within this directory, organized by database and tablespace. Users don't interact directly with these files; PostgreSQL handles the storage and retrieval through SQL commands.

### **Role of pgAdmin 4 and DBeaver**
- **pgAdmin 4** and **DBeaver** are **database client tools**. They:
  - Help you connect to a PostgreSQL server.
  - Provide a graphical or tabular interface for interacting with your databases.
  - Offer tools for querying, managing, and visualizing your data.

### **In Summary**:
- The data is stored on the **PostgreSQL server machine** in its designated data directory.
- **pgAdmin 4** and **DBeaver** are just clients that help you manage and interact with that data. They don’t store the database data themselves; they only store connection configurations (like credentials and server details) for accessing the PostgreSQL database. 

------------------------------------------------------------
that means all the data for example i create a database in pgAdmin and then add several csv files, those table is actually stored locally in my computer? and in that directory that you said before?

Yes, that's correct! When you create a database in **pgAdmin** (or any PostgreSQL client) and import CSV files into tables, the actual data is stored locally on your computer, specifically in the **PostgreSQL data directory**.

### Here's the process:
1. **Creating a Database:**
   - When you create a database using **pgAdmin** or another tool, PostgreSQL allocates space in its data directory for that database.

2. **Importing CSV Files:**
   - When you load CSV data into tables, PostgreSQL stores this data in binary format within its data directory. It is not stored in the CSV file format anymore, but as efficient data structures that PostgreSQL uses internally.

3. **Data Directory Location:**
   - The PostgreSQL data directory is typically configured during PostgreSQL installation. By default:
     - On **Linux**: It might be in `/var/lib/postgresql/<version>/main/` or `/var/lib/pgsql/<version>/data/`.
     - On **Windows**: It could be `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\`.

   - Inside this directory, PostgreSQL organizes files by databases and tablespaces. However, these files are not human-readable and can only be accessed and managed through PostgreSQL itself.

### Example:
- If you’re running PostgreSQL locally on your computer:
  - **pgAdmin** connects to your local PostgreSQL server.
  - The data you import via CSV is stored in your local PostgreSQL data directory.
  - **DBeaver** can also connect to the same server to query and interact with the data.

### How to Find Your PostgreSQL Data Directory:
To confirm the location of your PostgreSQL data directory:
1. **In pgAdmin:**
   - Go to the **Properties** tab of your server and look for the `Data Directory` field.
2. **Using SQL:**
   Run the query:
   ```sql
   SHOW data_directory;
   ```

### In Summary:
- **pgAdmin** and **DBeaver** are just tools to interact with your PostgreSQL server.
- The data you add (e.g., from CSV files) is stored on your local machine, specifically in PostgreSQL's data directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------

now one question, the databases and tables that i have created in pgAdmin, can i also see that changes or updates in dbeaver then if they are stored locally?


Yes, absolutely! Since **pgAdmin** and **DBeaver** are just client tools that connect to the same PostgreSQL server, any databases and tables you create or modify in one tool will be visible and accessible in the other, as long as they connect to the same PostgreSQL instance. 

### Here's how it works:
1. **Shared PostgreSQL Server:**
   - The PostgreSQL server is the central system that stores all your databases, tables, and data.
   - Both **pgAdmin** and **DBeaver** connect to this server using a connection configuration (hostname, port, username, password, and database name).

2. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Any changes you make through **pgAdmin**—such as creating databases, tables, or inserting data—are immediately reflected in the PostgreSQL server.
   - When you open **DBeaver** and connect to the same PostgreSQL server, it fetches the current state of the server, so you’ll see all the changes.

3. **Example Workflow:**
   - Create a database and tables in **pgAdmin**.
   - Add or update data in **pgAdmin**.
   - Open **DBeaver**, connect to the same server, and navigate to the same database.
   - You’ll see the database, tables, and the data you added or modified in **pgAdmin**.

4. **Requirements:**
   - Ensure both **pgAdmin** and **DBeaver** are configured to connect to the same PostgreSQL instance (same hostname, port, and credentials).

### Checking in DBeaver:
- Once connected in DBeaver:
  - Expand the database in the navigation pane.
  - Navigate to **Schemas → public** (or other schemas if applicable).
  - You'll find all the tables and data.

### Recap:
- Changes made in **pgAdmin** are stored in the PostgreSQL server and are accessible in **DBeaver**.
- Similarly, changes made in **DBeaver** will be visible in **pgAdmin**, as they both operate on the same underlying data in the PostgreSQL server.

i see, but for other systems that utilize the cloud, like snowflake, bigquery, etc, the data is not stored locally inside my computer like postgres right? or does postgres data can also behave like those cloud databases? 

You're absolutely correct! **Cloud databases** like **Snowflake** and **BigQuery** operate differently from a local PostgreSQL server. Let’s break it down:

---

### **1. Cloud Databases (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.)**
- **Data Storage**:
  - The data is stored in the cloud, meaning it resides on servers managed by the cloud provider (e.g., Google Cloud for BigQuery, AWS or Azure for Snowflake).
  - You do not have direct access to the physical storage; the cloud provider takes care of storage, backups, and scaling.

- **Access**:
  - You connect to the database through the internet using tools like web-based interfaces, APIs, or client applications such as DBeaver or custom scripts.
  - All queries and operations are sent to the provider’s servers, and results are sent back to your local machine.

- **Scalability**:
  - Cloud databases are highly scalable. For example, BigQuery automatically scales to handle petabytes of data.
  - You don’t need to worry about managing storage or compute resources manually; it’s handled by the cloud provider.

---

### **2. Local PostgreSQL**
- **Data Storage**:
  - By default, PostgreSQL stores data **locally** on the machine where the server is installed.
  - This means you need to manage disk space, backups, and scaling on your own.

- **Access**:
  - Typically accessed on the local machine, but it can also be configured to allow remote connections.
  - If hosted on a server, it behaves similarly to a cloud database but with more manual management required.

- **Scaling**:
  - PostgreSQL is not as easy to scale as a cloud database. You’d need to handle things like replication, clustering, or sharding to scale your workloads.

---

### **3. Can PostgreSQL Behave Like a Cloud Database?**
Yes, PostgreSQL can behave like a cloud database if deployed in a cloud environment or as a managed service. Examples include:
1. **Self-Hosted in the Cloud**:
   - You can set up a PostgreSQL server on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, Azure Virtual Machines).
   - In this setup, you still manage the PostgreSQL instance, backups, and scaling.

2. **Managed PostgreSQL Services**:
   - Many cloud providers offer **managed PostgreSQL services** that function like cloud databases:
     - **AWS RDS for PostgreSQL**
     - **Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL**
     - **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
   - In these cases, the provider manages the infrastructure, scaling, backups, and security. You only worry about your data and queries.

3. **PostgreSQL-Compatible Cloud Solutions**:
   - Fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible databases such as:
     - **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL**
     - **Neon** (a cloud-native PostgreSQL solution)
   - These solutions are designed to combine PostgreSQL's features with the scalability and ease of use of cloud databases.

### **Key Differences Between Cloud and Local PostgreSQL**
| Feature               | Local PostgreSQL           | Cloud Databases (Snowflake, BigQuery)       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Data Location**     | Stored locally             | Stored in the cloud                         |
| **Scalability**       | Limited, manual setup      | Virtually unlimited, auto-scaled           |
| **Backup Management** | You manage backups         | Managed by provider                         |
| **Access**            | Local or manual remote     | Internet-based access                       |
| **Cost**              | Hardware/software costs    | Pay-as-you-go or subscription               |

---

### In Summary:
- For **PostgreSQL**, the data is stored locally by default, but it can be deployed on the cloud to behave like a cloud database.
- For **cloud databases** like Snowflake and BigQuery, the data is stored remotely, fully managed, and highly scalable.
