what does an embedding model actually does? so i knew in RAG we usually take a for example pdf document and then use splitting, and then the splitted texts will then be passed into an embedding model like openai embedding model right? which will then be stored inside the vector database. 

You're absolutely right about the general steps in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. Let’s dive into **what an embedding model *actually* does**, and why it’s critical in this flow.

---

### 🔍 What an Embedding Model Does

An **embedding model** takes text (like a sentence, paragraph, or chunk of a document) and converts it into a **dense vector of numbers** — this is called an **embedding**.

These vectors are:

* High-dimensional (e.g., 1536 dimensions for OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`)
* Designed so that **semantic similarity** between pieces of text is preserved:
  → **Similar meanings = closer vectors (small cosine distance)**
  → **Different meanings = farther vectors**

---

### 🧠 Why Is This Useful in RAG?

Let’s break down how it fits into RAG:

1. **Split the Document**
   Long documents are split into chunks (e.g., 100–500 words) to stay within token limits and ensure meaningful text segments.

2. **Embed Each Chunk**
   Each chunk is passed into the **embedding model**:

   ```python
   embedding = embedding_model.embed(chunk)
   ```

   This gives you a vector like:

   ```
   [0.0123, -0.4567, ..., 0.0789]  # (e.g., 1536-dimensional)
   ```

3. **Store in Vector DB**
   These vectors are stored in a **vector database** (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate) along with the original text chunks.
   The database is now ready for semantic search.

4. **Query Time: Semantic Search**
   When a user asks a question:

   * That **question is also embedded** into a vector
   * The vector DB finds the **most similar vectors** (chunks) based on similarity (cosine similarity or dot product)
   * These chunks are retrieved and passed to the LLM to generate a final answer (augmented by relevant context)

---

### 🤖 Summary Analogy

> Think of the embedding model as a "semantic translator" that converts text into a format where meaning is geometry.

* “Text A and Text B are similar” → their vectors will be **close** in space
* This lets you **search by meaning**, not just by keywords

---

Let me know if you want to visualize this or go deeper into a specific step (e.g., cosine similarity, embedding dimensionality, or vector DB internals).

so when i make a query like what is the company return policy?, what will happen in a RAG process here considering we already store that information in our vector database, like the modified original query becomes what and how is the flow of the original prompt/query here that will be passed to the llm for the final answer


Great question — you're now looking at the **heart of how RAG actually performs semantic retrieval and generation**. Let’s break down the **exact flow** of a query like:

> ❓ *"What is the company return policy?"*

…in a RAG system that already has a PDF with that info stored in the vector database.

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Flow of a Query in RAG

---

### **1. User Query → Embedding**

Your original query:

```
"What is the company return policy?"
```

…is **embedded** into a high-dimensional vector using the same embedding model used during document preprocessing.

```python
query_embedding = embedding_model.embed("What is the company return policy?")
```

---

### **2. Query Embedding → Vector Search**

This vector is used to perform a **semantic search** in the **vector database**.

```python
top_chunks = vector_db.search(query_embedding, top_k=3)
```

The vector DB returns the most **semantically similar chunks** (i.e., pieces of the document) — for example:

```
[
  "Customers may return unused products within 30 days of delivery for a full refund.",
  "Refunds are processed within 5 business days after receiving the returned item.",
  "Return shipping costs are the customer's responsibility unless the product is defective."
]
```

---

### **3. Retrieved Chunks → Context**

These retrieved chunks become the **context** for the final answer generation.

At this point, the system creates a **modified prompt** that looks something like this:

```
[System Prompt]
You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question using the provided context.

[Context]
Customers may return unused products within 30 days of delivery for a full refund.
Refunds are processed within 5 business days after receiving the returned item.
Return shipping costs are the customer's responsibility unless the product is defective.

[User Question]
What is the company return policy?
```

This **prompt is sent to the LLM** (e.g., GPT-4) for final answer generation.

---

### **4. LLM → Final Answer**

The LLM processes the above full prompt and produces a grounded, context-aware answer like:

> "The company allows customers to return unused products within 30 days for a full refund. Refunds are processed within 5 business days, and customers are responsible for return shipping unless the product is defective."

---

## 🧠 Recap: What Happens to Your Query?

| Stage                    | What Happens                                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Original Query**       | "What is the company return policy?"                     |
| **Embedding**            | Converted to vector using embedding model                |
| **Vector Search**        | Finds semantically similar chunks from your document     |
| **Context Construction** | Those chunks + your query are formatted as input for LLM |
| **Final Prompt**         | \[Context] + \[User Query] → sent to LLM                 |
| **LLM Output**           | Grounded answer generated using both query and context   |

Let me know if you want to see this flow in code or want help implementing it with `LangChain`, `LlamaIndex`, or bare Python.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

okay can you give me a code example of that whole process of return policy rag using langchain? as for the vector database let's say we use chromadb


Absolutely! Here's a **complete RAG pipeline example using LangChain and ChromaDB** for your use case:

> 📄 Use case: You’ve stored a document with the company return policy and want to answer:
> ❓ *"What is the company return policy?"*

We'll use:

* **LangChain** for orchestration
* **OpenAI Embeddings**
* **Chroma** as the vector database
* **OpenAI LLM** (you can switch it later)

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Install these:

```bash
pip install langchain openai chromadb tiktoken
```

Set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

---

## 🧠 Full Example Code

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# --- Step 1: Load and Split the Document ---
loader = TextLoader("company_policy.txt")  # your PDF content in plain text format
docs = loader.load()

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=100)
splitted_docs = splitter.split_documents(docs)

# --- Step 2: Embed and Store in Chroma ---
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_db = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splitted_docs, embedding=embedding_model, persist_directory="./chroma_store")

# Optional: Persisted store (skip embedding next time)
vector_db.persist()

# --- Step 3: Create Retriever and RAG Chain ---
retriever = vector_db.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 3})
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)

rag_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",  # simplest method to pass context
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True
)

# --- Step 4: Ask Your Question ---
query = "What is the company return policy?"
response = rag_chain(query)

# --- Step 5: Output ---
print("Answer:", response['result'])

# Optional: Print source chunks
print("\nSource Documents:")
for doc in response['source_documents']:
    print("-", doc.page_content)
```

---

## 📁 File `company_policy.txt` (Example Content)

Make sure you have this file saved:

```
Our return policy allows customers to return unused items within 30 days of purchase. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method. Customers are responsible for return shipping unless the product is defective.
```

---

## 🔁 Output Example

```text
Answer: Customers can return unused items within 30 days. Refunds go to the original payment method. Return shipping is paid by the customer unless the product is defective.

Source Documents:
- Our return policy allows customers to return unused items within 30 days...
```

---

## 🧩 Notes:

* You can replace `TextLoader` with `PyPDFLoader` if using PDF directly.
* Chroma automatically stores and reloads from disk if `persist_directory` is set.
* You can expand this to a full app using Streamlit or FastAPI.

Let me know if you want:

* A PDF loader version
* A web interface with Streamlit
* A multi-file ingest pipeline

I'm happy to walk you through it!

can you change the implementation of rag chain to using the LCEL? and which approach do you think is better, is it using the RetrievalQA or using the LCEL? i believe using the LCEL is like a general approach? 


Great thinking — you're spot on!

### ✅ Quick Answers:

* **LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)** is **more flexible, modular, and composable** than `RetrievalQA`.
* `RetrievalQA` is a **prebuilt chain** — simple, fast for basic use cases.
* **LCEL is recommended** when:

  * You want **fine-grained control** over how the prompt is constructed
  * You need to **customize** chunk formatting, rerank results, use multi-step logic, or debug deeper.

prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a helpful assistant. Use the context below to answer the question.
If you don't know, just say so.

Context:

Question: {question}
""")

# --- Step 5: Define RAG Chain with LCEL ---
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)

rag_chain = (
    RunnableMap({
        "context": lambda input: retriever.invoke(input["question"]),
        "question": lambda input: input["question"],
    })
    .map(lambda d: {
        "context": "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in d["context"]),
        "question": d["question"]
    })
    | prompt_template
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

# --- Step 6: Query ---
question = "What is the company return policy?"
response = rag_chain.invoke({"question": question})
print("Answer:", response)
```
