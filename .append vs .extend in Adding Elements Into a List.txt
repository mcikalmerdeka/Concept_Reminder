# Let's obtain the results of the first 5 pages
results = []

for i in range(5):
    r =  requests.get(base_site, params = {"page": i+1})

    if len(r.json()) == 0:   # We have reached the end of the results
        break
    else:
        # Add the response results to our list of results
        results.extend(r.json())

what is the difference between using append and extend to add response result to my empty list of results?

Let me explain the key difference between `append` and `extend` in Python lists:

`append` adds a single element to the end of the list, while `extend` adds all elements from an iterable (like a list) individually to the end of the list.

Here's a practical example to illustrate:

```python
# Using append
list1 = []
response_data = [1, 2, 3]
list1.append(response_data)
print(list1)  # Output: [[1, 2, 3]]  <- Creates a nested list

# Using extend
list2 = []
response_data = [1, 2, 3]
list2.extend(response_data)
print(list2)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]    <- Adds individual elements
```

In your API request code:
- If you used `results.append(r.json())`, you'd get a list of lists, where each response is a nested list
- Using `results.extend(r.json())` as you did is correct because it takes all items from the JSON response and adds them individually to your results list

This is particularly important when working with API responses because:
1. `r.json()` typically returns a list of items
2. You usually want all items in a single flat list rather than a nested structure
3. Using `extend` makes it easier to process all results together later

-----------------------------------------------------------

I'll provide detailed examples showing how `append` and `extend` work differently with various data types and explain each step:

```python
# Example 1: Basic list operations
numbers = []

# Using append
numbers.append([1, 2, 3])
print(numbers)  # Output: [[1, 2, 3]]
# Explanation: append adds the entire list [1, 2, 3] as a single element
# numbers now contains one element which is itself a list

numbers = []  # Reset the list
numbers.extend([1, 2, 3])
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
# Explanation: extend unpacks the list and adds each element individually
# numbers now contains three separate elements

# Example 2: Multiple operations
list_a = [1, 2]

# Using append multiple times
list_a.append([3, 4])
list_a.append([5, 6])
print(list_a)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6]]
# Explanation: Each append adds a new list as a single element
# The result is a list with 4 elements, where two elements are nested lists

list_b = [1, 2]
# Using extend multiple times
list_b.extend([3, 4])
list_b.extend([5, 6])
print(list_b)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# Explanation: Each extend adds individual elements
# The result is a flat list with 6 elements

# Example 3: Working with different data types
mixed_list = []

# Using append with different types
mixed_list.append("hello")
mixed_list.append([1, 2])
mixed_list.append({"name": "John"})
print(mixed_list)  # Output: ['hello', [1, 2], {'name': 'John'}]
# Explanation: Each element is added as-is, preserving its type
# The list contains 3 elements of different types

mixed_list = []
# Using extend with different types
mixed_list.extend("hello")
print(mixed_list)  # Output: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
# Explanation: extend treats strings as iterables and adds each character
# The list contains 5 elements, each a single character

# Example 4: API-like scenario
api_response1 = [{"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}]
api_response2 = [{"id": 3, "name": "Charlie"}]

# Using append
results_append = []
results_append.append(api_response1)
results_append.append(api_response2)
print(results_append)  
# Output: [
#   [{"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}],
#   [{"id": 3, "name": "Charlie"}]
# ]
# Explanation: Creates a nested structure that's harder to process

# Using extend
results_extend = []
results_extend.extend(api_response1)
results_extend.extend(api_response2)
print(results_extend)  
# Output: [
#   {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"},
#   {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"},
#   {"id": 3, "name": "Charlie"}
# ]
# Explanation: Creates a flat list of dictionaries, easier to process
```

Key takeaways:
1. `append` always adds exactly one element to the list, even if that element is itself a list
2. `extend` adds each element from the iterable separately
3. `extend` works with any iterable (lists, tuples, strings, etc.)
4. For API responses, `extend` is usually preferred as it creates a flat list of results
5. `append` creates nested structures while `extend` creates flat structures

When to use each:
- Use `append` when you want to add a single element or want to maintain nested structure
- Use `extend` when you want to combine lists or add multiple elements from an iterable as individual elements
- For API responses with multiple results, `extend` is typically the better choice as it makes the data easier to process later
