# Concept_Reminder

This repository serves as a reminder of concepts that I didn't fully understand at certain points, usually coming from pure curiosity or chain reaction from when I was learning something and suddenly had thought of it. After searching and digging up more information (which most of it comes from prompting in LLMs for definition and examples that i could try myself), I started to understand it.
