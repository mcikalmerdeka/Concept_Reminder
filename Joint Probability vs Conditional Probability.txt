what is the difference between this 2 probability:
P(positive, infected) and P(positive | infected)

Great question ‚Äî this is a **fundamental concept in probability** that often trips people up, especially in contexts like medical testing.

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly üëá

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **P(positive, infected)**

This means:

> The **joint probability** that a person is both *positive* **and** *infected* at the same time.

It answers:

> ‚ÄúWhat is the probability that a randomly chosen person is infected **and** the test result is positive?‚Äù

It combines both conditions **simultaneously**.

Formally:
[
P(\text{positive, infected}) = P(\text{positive} \cap \text{infected})
]

Example:
If 1% of the population is infected and the test detects infection correctly 99% of the time:
[
P(\text{positive, infected}) = P(\text{positive | infected}) \times P(\text{infected})
]
[
= 0.99 \times 0.01 = 0.0099
]
So, **0.99%** of the population are both infected and test positive.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **P(positive | infected)**

This means:

> The **conditional probability** that a person tests positive **given that they are infected**.

It answers:

> ‚ÄúIf we already know someone is infected, what‚Äôs the chance the test will correctly show positive?‚Äù

Formally:
[
P(\text{positive | infected}) = \frac{P(\text{positive, infected})}{P(\text{infected})}
]

Using the same example:
[
P(\text{positive | infected}) = \frac{0.0099}{0.01} = 0.99
]
So, **99%** of infected people test positive.

### üí° In summary

| Expression                | Type              | Meaning                        | Example value                            |      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---- |
| **P(positive, infected)** | Joint probability | Probability that both are true | 0.0099                                   |      |
| **P(positive              | infected)**       | Conditional probability        | Probability of positive *given* infected | 0.99 |
