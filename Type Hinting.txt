The practice you're referring to is called "type hinting" in Python. Let me explain its purpose and behavior:

1. Purpose:
   - Type hints provide information about the expected data types of function parameters and return values.
   - They improve code readability and serve as documentation.
   - They enable better tooling support (e.g., IDE autocompletion, type checking).

2. Behavior:
   - Type hints are not enforced at runtime by default. The function will still work if you pass other data types.
   - They are mainly used for static type checking and documentation purposes.

3. Examples and explanation:

Let's use your example and expand on it:

```python
def rect_calc(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    area = x * y
    return area

# These will work:
print(rect_calc(5.0, 3.0))  # 15.0
print(rect_calc(5, 3))      # 15 (integers are accepted)
print(rect_calc("5", "3"))  # "555" (strings will work, but produce unexpected results)

# This will work but might cause issues later:
print(rect_calc([1,2], 3))  # TypeError when trying to multiply list and int
```

As you can see, the function still works with different data types, but it might produce unexpected results or errors.

Here are more examples:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def process_list(items: list[int]) -> int:
    return sum(items)

from typing import Union

def flexible_add(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> float:
    return a + b
```

4. Benefits of type hinting:
   - Improved code readability
   - Better IDE support (autocomplete, error detection)
   - Easier to understand function interfaces
   - Helps catch type-related errors early when using type checking tools

5. Type checking:
   While Python doesn't enforce these types at runtime, you can use tools like mypy to perform static type checking based on these hints.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The `->` symbol in Python function definitions is used to indicate the return type of the function. It's part of the type hinting syntax and specifies what data type the function is expected to return.

Here's a breakdown:

```python
def function_name(parameter: parameter_type) -> return_type:
    # function body
    return something
```

Let's look at some examples:

1. Function returning an integer:
   ```python
   def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
       return a + b
   ```

2. Function returning a string:
   ```python
   def greet(name: str) -> str:
       return f"Hello, {name}!"
   ```

3. Function returning a list of strings:
   ```python
   def get_weekdays() -> list[str]:
       return ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
   ```

4. Function returning None (void function):
   ```python
   def print_message(msg: str) -> None:
       print(msg)
   ```

5. Function with multiple return types:
   ```python
   from typing import Union

   def divide(a: float, b: float) -> Union[float, str]:
       if b != 0:
           return a / b
       else:
           return "Error: Division by zero"
   ```

As with parameter type hints, the return type hint doesn't enforce the actual return type at runtime. It's primarily used for documentation, improved IDE support, and static type checking.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

That's correct. The type hints, including the return type indicated by `->`, don't affect the function's runtime behavior. Their main purposes are:

1. Documentation: They serve as inline documentation, making it clear what types are expected and returned.

2. Static type checking: Tools like mypy can use these hints to catch type-related errors before runtime.

3. IDE support: Integrated Development Environments can provide better autocompletion and error detection based on these hints.

4. Code readability: They make the code more self-documenting and easier to understand at a glance.

So you're absolutely right - whether you add type hints or not, the function will behave the same way when executed. Python remains dynamically typed, and these hints are not enforced at runtime.

For example, these two functions are functionally identical at runtime:

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

The type hints are optional and can be gradually added to existing code without breaking functionality. They're particularly useful in larger projects or when working in teams, as they help clarify intentions and catch potential issues early in the development process.
