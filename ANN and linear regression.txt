is artificial neural network model in deep learning are just a bunch of linear regression?

Artificial neural network (ANN) models in deep learning are not just a bunch of linear regressions. While linear regression can be considered a basic building block of some neural network layers, such as the fully connected layers, ANNs encompass a broader range of operations and architectures. Deep learning models leverage nonlinear activation functions, multiple layers, and complex connections between neurons, enabling them to learn intricate patterns and relationships in data that linear regression alone cannot capture.
