if i use git add but havent commit how can i undo that?

If you've added files to the staging area with `git add` but haven't committed yet, you can undo it by using:

```bash
git reset
```

### Explanation:
1. **Unstage specific files**:
   To unstage a specific file or files, run:
   ```bash
   git reset <file>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   git reset myfile.txt
   ```

2. **Unstage all files**:
   To unstage everything that you've added:
   ```bash
   git reset
   ```

### Notes:
- This action only removes the files from the staging area. It doesn’t delete or modify the files in your working directory.
- If you want to completely discard changes in the working directory as well, you'd need to use:
   ```bash
   git checkout -- <file>
   ```
   (Or `git restore <file>` in newer Git versions.) Use this carefully, as it discards changes.

what about i already add and commit but havent push it yet?

If you've already **added** and **committed** your changes but haven't pushed them, you can undo or modify the commit using the following commands:

### 1. **Amend the Last Commit**
   If you want to adjust the last commit (e.g., fix a message, add more changes):
   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   ```
   - This opens your default text editor to allow you to change the commit message.
   - If you’ve added more changes, the amended commit will include them.

### 2. **Undo the Last Commit (Keep Changes in Working Directory)**
   To unstage the last commit but keep the changes in your working directory:
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```
   - `HEAD~1` refers to the last commit.
   - The changes will remain staged, so you can re-commit them after making edits.

### 3. **Undo the Last Commit (Discard Changes)**
   To undo the last commit and discard changes entirely:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```
   - Be **very careful** with this, as it will permanently remove the changes.

### 4. **Undo the Last Commit (Keep Changes in the Index/Staging Area)**
   To undo the commit but keep the changes staged:
   ```bash
   git reset --mixed HEAD~1
   ```

### Example Use Case:
1. You commit some changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Oops, wrong commit"
   ```
2. Realize the mistake before pushing:
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```
3. Fix your changes or re-commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Corrected commit message"
   ```

This way, the changes won't go to the remote repository until you're satisfied.

and lastly what about i already push it and i want to undo it but no go to the previous starting point before i applied the edit, i just want to go back to the condition before i git add the file

If you’ve already **pushed** your commit but want to undo it and return to the condition before you ran `git add`, you can do this while keeping your working directory as it was before you staged the changes. Here’s how:

---

### 1. **Undo the Commit and Push (Keep Changes in Working Directory)**

#### Steps:
1. **Undo the Commit Locally:**
   Use `git reset` to move the commit back to the staging area or remove it entirely:
   ```bash
   git reset --mixed HEAD~1
   ```
   - This will:
     - Remove the last commit from history.
     - Keep the changes in your working directory **unstaged**.

2. **Force Push to Remote:**
   Since you’ve already pushed the commit to the remote, you need to update the remote branch to match your local branch:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```
   - Be cautious with `--force`, as it rewrites history and can impact others working on the same branch.

---

### 2. **Undo the Commit and Push (Return to Condition Before `git add`)**

If you want to fully unstage everything **and discard the staged changes**, do this:

#### Steps:
1. **Undo the Commit Locally:**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

2. **Force Push to Remote:**
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```
   - This ensures the remote branch matches the reset local branch.

---

### 3. **Alternative: Revert the Commit**

If you don’t want to rewrite history but instead "undo" the commit with a new commit:

#### Steps:
1. **Revert the Commit:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```
   - This creates a new commit that reverses the changes of the specified commit.
   - You can find the `<commit-hash>` from `git log`.

2. **Push the Revert Commit:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

This method is safer in a shared branch because it avoids rewriting history.

---

### Use Cases:
- **Use `git reset --mixed`**: If you want to keep the changes unstaged (before `git add`).
- **Use `git reset --hard`**: If you want to discard the changes completely.
- **Use `git revert`**: If you need a record of undoing the commit without rewriting history.
