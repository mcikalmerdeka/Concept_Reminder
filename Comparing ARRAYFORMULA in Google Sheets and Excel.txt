The ARRAYFORMULA function is indeed specific to Google Sheets. In Microsoft Excel, there are a few different ways to achieve similar functionality:

1. Dynamic Arrays (Modern Excel 2021/365):
- Excel now automatically spills array results without needing a special function
- Just enter the formula once and it automatically expands
- Example: `=A1:A10*2` will multiply all values without dragging

2. For older Excel versions:
- Use CSE (Ctrl+Shift+Enter) formulas, also known as array formulas
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter after entering the formula
- These formulas will be enclosed in curly braces {=formula}

Here's a quick comparison:

Google Sheets:
```
=ARRAYFORMULA(A1:A10*2)
```

Modern Excel:
```
=A1:A10*2  (it spills automatically)
```

Older Excel:
```
{=A1:A10*2}  (press Ctrl+Shift+Enter)
```

-------------------------------------------------------------

I'll show you examples with sample data and their outputs. I'll use a few representative cases:

1. Concatenating Text with Range:

Input Data (Column A):
```
ID    
1     
2     
3     
```

Google Sheets:
```
=ARRAYFORMULA("ID-"&A2:A4)
```

Excel 2021:
```
="ID-"&A2:A4
```

Output:
```
ID-1
ID-2
ID-3
```

2. Multiple Operations with Numbers:

Input Data:
```
A     B     C
10    2     5
20    3     2
30    4     1
```

Google Sheets:
```
=ARRAYFORMULA(A2:A4*B2:B4+C2:C4)
```

Excel 2021:
```
=A2:A4*B2:B4+C2:C4
```

Output:
```
25   (10*2+5)
62   (20*3+2)
121  (30*4+1)
```

3. IF Conditions:

Input Data (Column A):
```
Value
8
12
15
```

Google Sheets:
```
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A4>10,"High","Low"))
```

Excel 2021:
```
=IF(A2:A4>10,"High","Low")
```

Output:
```
Low
High
High
```

4. Text Joining with Multiple Columns:

Input Data:
```
A        B        C
Name     City     Age
John     NYC      25
Mary     LA       30
Bob      CHI      28
```

Google Sheets:
```
=ARRAYFORMULA(A2:A4&" - "&B2:B4&" ("&C2:C4&")")
```

Excel 2021:
```
=A2:A4&" - "&B2:B4&" ("&C2:C4&")"
```

Output:
```
John - NYC (25)
Mary - LA (30)
Bob - CHI (28)
```

5. Working with Text Case:

Input Data (Column A):
```
Name
ROBERT
SUSAN
JAMES
```

Google Sheets:
```
=ARRAYFORMULA(UPPER(LEFT(A2:A4,1))&LOWER(RIGHT(A2:A4,LEN(A2:A4)-1)))
```

Excel 2021:
```
=UPPER(LEFT(A2:A4,1))&LOWER(RIGHT(A2:A4,LEN(A2:A4)-1))
```

Output:
```
Robert
Susan
James
```

6. Date Calculations:

Input Data (Column A):
```
Date
1/1/2024
2/1/2024
3/1/2024
```

Google Sheets:
```
=ARRAYFORMULA(EDATE(A2:A4,1))
```

Excel 2021:
```
=EDATE(A2:A4,1)
```

Output:
```
2/1/2024
3/1/2024
4/1/2024
```

7. Nested Calculations:

Input Data (Column A):
```
Number
10.456
20.789
30.123
```

Google Sheets:
```
=ARRAYFORMULA(ROUND(A2:A4*1.5,2))
```

Excel 2021:
```
=ROUND(A2:A4*1.5,2)
```

Output:
```
15.68
31.18
45.18
```

Key things to notice:
1. The outputs are identical in both Excel and Google Sheets
2. Excel 2021 automatically spills the results into adjacent cells
3. The main difference is just in the syntax - Excel doesn't need ARRAYFORMULA
4. Both will automatically update if you change any input values

-----------------------------------------------------------

as for the excel 2021, does that mean i only need to input the formula into 1 cell, and doesnot need to drag it all the way down to apply the formula?


Yes, exactly! In Excel 2021, you only need to enter the formula in one cell and it will automatically "spill" down or across to show all results. This is one of the major improvements in modern Excel (2021/365) with dynamic arrays.

Let me demonstrate with a simple example:

Input Data (Column A):
```
Name
John
Mary
Bob
Sarah
Mike
```

In Excel 2021:
1. Just enter in cell B1:
```
="Hello "&A1:A6
```
It will automatically fill down like this:
```
Hello Name
Hello John
Hello Mary
Hello Bob
Hello Sarah
Hello Mike
```

The key differences from older Excel versions:
1. ✅ No need to drag formulas down
2. ✅ No need to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter
3. ✅ No need to pre-select the range
4. ⚠️ Just make sure there are no occupied cells below where the results will "spill"

If there are occupied cells blocking the spill range, you'll see a #SPILL! error. For example:
```
Cell B1: ="Hello "&A1:A6
Cell B3: (if this cell has any content)
```
Result in B1: #SPILL!

To fix a #SPILL! error, you just need to:
1. Clear the cells in the spill range, or
2. Move your formula to a location with enough empty cells for the results

------------------------------------------------------------

what is the limitation of this though, for example if i want to use one of the filled down cell then i cant specify it because this other cell does not contains formula ?


Ah, good question! In Excel 2021, you can reference spilled array results using the @ operator (implicit intersection operator) or # (spill operator). Let me show you some examples:

1. Basic Spill Reference:

Column A:
```
Name
John
Mary
Bob
```

In B1:
```
="ID-"&A1:A4  (This spills down automatically)
```

Result in Column B:
```
ID-Name
ID-John
ID-Mary
ID-Bob
```

Now if you want to reference these results:

2. Referencing Individual Cells:
```
=@B1   (References first cell only - "ID-Name")
=B1#   (References entire spilled range - all "ID-" values)
```

3. Practical Example with Multiple References:

```
A        B                C
Name     ="ID-"&A1:A4     =LEN(B1#)
John
Mary
Bob
```

Column B spills:
```
ID-Name
ID-John
ID-Mary
ID-Bob
```

Column C spills (length of each value):
```
7
7
7
6
```

4. More Complex Example:

```
A        B                    C                           D
Name     ="ID-"&A1:A4         =IF(LEN(B1#)>6,"Long","Short")    =B1#&" - "&C1#
John
Mary
Bob
```

Results:
```
Column B    Column C    Column D
ID-Name     Long        ID-Name - Long
ID-John     Long        ID-John - Long
ID-Mary     Long        ID-Mary - Long
ID-Bob      Short       ID-Bob - Short
```

Key Points:
1. Use `@` when you want a single value from a spilled range
2. Use `#` when you want the entire spilled range
3. You can combine multiple spilled ranges in calculations
4. The spill operator (#) ensures the formula knows to work with the entire range

Common Patterns:
```
=B1#    - Reference entire spilled range
=@B1    - Reference just the first value
=INDEX(B1#,2)  - Reference specific row in spilled range
=B1#&C1#  - Combine two spilled ranges
```

Limitations:
1. Can't reference partial ranges of spilled results (must use INDEX or similar)
2. All spilled ranges must be the same size when combining them
3. Can't have any occupied cells in the spill range
4. Can't directly reference "future" spilled cells without using the # operator
