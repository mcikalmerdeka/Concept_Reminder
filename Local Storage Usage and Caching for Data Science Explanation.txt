there is another thing that i want to ask related to storage used, if whenever i want to create a project in my local pc i always create a virtual environment and then install packages required there, do you think that's also use quite a lot of storage in my pc? if so how can i check this, like how many virtual environment have i created and how much spaces do they use in my laptop?

Yes, virtual environments can definitely consume significant storage, especially if you create many of them or install heavy packages like machine learning libraries. Each virtual environment is essentially a separate copy of Python plus all installed packages.

Here are several ways to check your virtual environments and their storage usage:

## For conda environments:
```bash
# List all conda environments
conda env list

# Check size of specific environment
conda list -n your_env_name

# Get detailed info about environment sizes
conda info --envs
```

## For venv/virtualenv environments:
These are typically stored in your project directories or in a central location. Common locations:
- Project folders (if you create them with `python -m venv venv`)
- `C:\Users\Cikal Merdeka\Envs\` (if using virtualenvwrapper)
- `C:\Users\Cikal Merdeka\.virtualenvs\`

## To find and measure storage:
1. **PowerShell command to find Python environments:**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Directory -Name "*venv*", "*env*", "*virtualenv*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object {Test-Path "$_\pyvenv.cfg"}
```

2. **Check folder sizes in File Explorer:**
   - Navigate to your projects folder
   - Right-click on folders containing `venv`, `env`, or `.venv`
   - Select "Properties" to see size

3. **PowerShell to get sizes:**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Directory | ForEach-Object {
    $size = (Get-ChildItem $_.FullName -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = $_.Name
        SizeGB = [math]::Round($size / 1GB, 2)
    }
} | Sort-Object SizeGB -Descending
```

## Storage optimization tips:
- Delete unused virtual environments
- Use `pip cache purge` to clear pip's download cache
- Consider using `pipenv` or `poetry` which can share dependencies
- For learning projects, you might reuse a single environment for similar projects
- Use `conda clean --all` to clean conda caches

Virtual environments with ML libraries (tensorflow, pytorch, etc.) can easily be 2-5GB each, so this cleanup can free substantial space.

but wait, if i created those project with those virtual environments not in my C disk but somewhere in a subfolder inside D or E disk, does that still consume the storage in C?

No, if you created your virtual environments in subfolders on your D or E drives, they **do not** consume storage on your C drive. Virtual environments are stored exactly where you create them.

So if you ran:
```bash
# In D:\my-projects\project1\
python -m venv venv
```

Then the virtual environment is stored in `D:\my-projects\project1\venv\` and uses D drive storage, not C drive storage.

However, there are a few things that might still be using C drive space:

## What could still be on C drive:
1. **Pip cache**: `C:\Users\Cikal Merdeka\AppData\Local\pip\cache\` - pip downloads packages here before installing them
2. **Python installation**: If Python itself is installed on C drive
3. **Conda environments**: If you use conda, environments are typically stored in `C:\Users\Cikal Merdeka\anaconda3\envs\` or similar
4. **System Python packages**: Any globally installed packages

## To check what's actually using C drive space:
```powershell
# Check pip cache size
Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\Cikal Merdeka\AppData\Local\pip\cache" -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum

# Find Python-related folders on C drive
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Directory -Name "*python*", "*conda*", "*anaconda*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## To clean up C drive Python-related storage:
```bash
# Clear pip cache
pip cache purge

# If using conda
conda clean --all
```

So your virtual environments on D/E drives aren't the culprit for C drive usage - it's more likely the Hugging Face cache we discussed earlier, pip cache, or other system-level Python installations.
