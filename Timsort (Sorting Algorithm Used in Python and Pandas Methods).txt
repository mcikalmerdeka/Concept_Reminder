in python or pandas sorting method, what kind of algorithm is used? is it bubble sort or something? 

In Python, the sorting algorithms used by the `sort()` method of lists and the `sorted()` function are **Timsort**. Similarly, in pandas, the sorting functions like `DataFrame.sort_values()` and `DataFrame.sort_index()` also rely on **Timsort**, as pandas leverages NumPy and Python's built-in sorting functionality under the hood.

### What is Timsort?
Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. It was designed to perform well on many real-world data sets, and it is the default sorting algorithm in Python since version 2.3.

### Key Features of Timsort:
1. **Stable Sort:** Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
2. **Optimized for Real Data:** Takes advantage of runs (pre-sorted segments) in the data to minimize sorting operations.
3. **Complexity:**
   - **Best Case:** \( O(n) \) for already sorted data.
   - **Worst Case:** \( O(n \log n) \).
   - **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \).

### Sorting in pandas
- `DataFrame.sort_values()` and `DataFrame.sort_index()` internally call NumPy's `np.sort()` for columnar or index sorting. NumPy's default algorithm is also Timsort for 1-dimensional arrays.
- For multi-dimensional data or specific dtypes (like `int` or `float`), pandas might use other optimized algorithms, depending on the context (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, heapsort).

### Why not Bubble Sort?
- Bubble Sort is an inefficient algorithm with \( O(n^2) \) time complexity in the worst and average cases, which makes it impractical for real-world use with large datasets.
- Modern libraries like Python's standard library or pandas prioritize efficiency, making algorithms like Timsort much more suitable.

can you give me the code example of implementing timsort? 

Implementing Timsort from scratch is a bit complex because it involves combining insertion sort and merge sort while also identifying and taking advantage of already sorted segments (called **runs**) in the data. However, here's a simplified implementation of Timsort in Python to demonstrate the core concepts:

```python
def insertion_sort(arr, left, right):
    for i in range(left + 1, right + 1):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= left and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key


def merge(arr, left, mid, right):
    # Left and right subarrays
    left_part = arr[left:mid + 1]
    right_part = arr[mid + 1:right + 1]
    
    i = j = 0
    k = left

    # Merge the two parts back into arr
    while i < len(left_part) and j < len(right_part):
        if left_part[i] <= right_part[j]:
            arr[k] = left_part[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            arr[k] = right_part[j]
            j += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy remaining elements
    while i < len(left_part):
        arr[k] = left_part[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1

    while j < len(right_part):
        arr[k] = right_part[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1


def timsort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    min_run = 32

    # Step 1: Break the array into chunks of size `min_run` and sort each chunk using insertion sort
    for start in range(0, n, min_run):
        end = min(start + min_run - 1, n - 1)
        insertion_sort(arr, start, end)

    # Step 2: Merge the sorted runs into a larger array
    size = min_run
    while size < n:
        for left in range(0, n, size * 2):
            mid = min(left + size - 1, n - 1)
            right = min(left + 2 * size - 1, n - 1)

            if mid < right:  # Only merge if there are two parts
                merge(arr, left, mid, right)

        size *= 2


# Example usage:
arr = [5, 21, 7, 23, 19, 1, 10, 2, 3, 8]
print("Original array:", arr)
timsort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

### How It Works:
1. **Run Identification:**
   - The array is divided into small chunks of size `min_run` (typically 32 in real Timsort implementations).
   - Each chunk is sorted using insertion sort because it is efficient for small arrays.

2. **Merge Runs:**
   - After sorting each run, adjacent runs are merged in pairs using a merging technique similar to merge sort.
   - The merging process is repeated with increasingly larger runs until the entire array is sorted.

### Output for the Example:
```plaintext
Original array: [5, 21, 7, 23, 19, 1, 10, 2, 3, 8]
Sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 19, 21, 23]
```

This is a simplified version and does not include optimizations like detecting natural runs or galloping mode, which are present in the full Timsort algorithm used in Python's standard library.
