You can check the size of a GitHub repository before cloning or forking it by using the following methods:

### 1. **Check the Repository Size on the GitHub Web Interface**
   - Open the repository in your browser.
   - Scroll down to the bottom of the main page.
   - Look at the **"Languages"** section on the right-hand side. The repository size is often displayed there, though this is just the size of the code files and doesn't include large files or Git history.

### 2. **Use the GitHub API**
   You can use the GitHub API to fetch repository details, including its size. Follow these steps:
   1. Replace `owner` and `repo` in the URL with the username and repository name, respectively:
      ```
      https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo
      ```
   2. Look for the `size` field in the JSON response. It gives the size of the repository in kilobytes (KB).

   Example:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo | grep '"size"'
   ```

### 3. **Use GitHub CLI**
   If you have the GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed, you can check repository information:
   ```bash
   gh repo view owner/repo
   ```
   The size is included in the details shown.

### 4. **Use GitHub Advanced Search**
   - Go to the GitHub search page: https://github.com/search
   - Use advanced search filters to find repositories by size using `size:`.
     For example:
     ```
     repo:owner/repo size:<10000
     ```
     This checks if the repository is under 10 MB.

### 5. **Check the `.git` Directory After Cloning (Optional)**
   If you have cloned a repository but want to analyze its storage usage, check the `.git` directory:
   ```bash
   du -sh .git
   ```

Using these methods, you can estimate whether a repository is manageable before deciding to fork or clone it.
