Ah, I see the confusion! In Python, when opening files using the `open()` function, the options for file modes (like `r`, `w`, etc.) specify how the file should be accessed. Here's a quick refresher:

### File Modes in Python
1. **`r` (Read)**  
   - Opens the file for reading.  
   - The file must exist, or you'll get a `FileNotFoundError`.  
   - Default mode if none is specified.
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
       content = f.read()
   ```

2. **`w` (Write)**  
   - Opens the file for writing.  
   - If the file exists, it truncates (overwrites) the file.  
   - If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one.
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
       f.write('Hello, world!')
   ```

3. **`x` (Exclusive Creation)**  
   - Creates a new file and opens it for writing.  
   - If the file already exists, it raises a `FileExistsError`.  
   ```python
   with open('new_file.txt', 'x') as f:
       f.write('This file is newly created!')
   ```

4. **`a` (Append)**  
   - Opens the file for writing and appends content to the end of the file.  
   - If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one.
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'a') as f:
       f.write('\nAppending this line.')
   ```

5. **`b` (Binary Mode)**  
   - Opens the file in binary mode (for non-text files like images or videos).  
   - Commonly combined with other modes (e.g., `rb`, `wb`).
   ```python
   with open('image.png', 'rb') as f:
       data = f.read()
   ```

6. **`t` (Text Mode)**  
   - Opens the file in text mode (for reading or writing strings).  
   - This is the default mode and is usually not explicitly specified.
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'rt') as f:
       lines = f.readlines()
   ```

7. **`+` (Read/Write)**  
   - Opens the file for both reading and writing.  
   - Typically combined with other modes (e.g., `r+`, `w+`, `a+`).
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r+') as f:
       content = f.read()
       f.write('\nAdding this line after reading.')
   ```

### Mode Combinations
You can combine modes to perform specific tasks:
- **`rb`**: Read in binary mode.
- **`wb`**: Write in binary mode.
- **`r+`**: Read and write (file must exist).
- **`w+`**: Write and read (truncates the file or creates a new one).
- **`a+`**: Append and read.

### Example Summary
```python
# Reading a file
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(f.read())

# Writing to a file
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Overwritten content.')

# Appending to a file
with open('file.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('\nAdditional content.')

# Reading and writing
with open('file.txt', 'r+') as f:
    content = f.read()
    f.write('\nAppending after reading.')
```
