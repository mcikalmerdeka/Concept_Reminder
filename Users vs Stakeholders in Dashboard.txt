In the context of building a dashboard, **users** and **stakeholders** refer to distinct but related groups involved in or affected by the project:

### **Users**
- **Definition**: Individuals who will directly interact with the dashboard to retrieve and interpret information.
- **Examples**:
  - Analysts using the dashboard to extract insights for reports.
  - Managers using it to track KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
  - Operational teams monitoring real-time metrics like sales or system performance.
- **Role in Dashboard Design**:
  - Provide insights into what data and metrics they need.
  - Influence usability and interactivity features (e.g., filters, drill-downs, custom views).
  - Drive the design of user-friendly layouts and visualizations.
- **Focus**: The dashboard should meet their day-to-day requirements and improve efficiency in decision-making.

### **Stakeholders**
- **Definition**: People or groups who have an interest in or influence over the project but may not use the dashboard directly.
- **Examples**:
  - Executives or department heads who fund the project and expect high-level summaries.
  - IT teams responsible for data infrastructure supporting the dashboard.
  - Compliance teams ensuring regulatory requirements are met in the data.
- **Role in Dashboard Design**:
  - Define the business goals and success criteria for the dashboard.
  - Provide approval for resource allocation and project milestones.
  - May specify high-level metrics or strategic insights that the dashboard should highlight.
- **Focus**: They are more concerned with the **outcomes** (e.g., insights driving business value) and ensuring the dashboard aligns with broader business strategies.

### **Key Differences**
- **Users**: Directly interact with the dashboard. Their needs shape the design, usability, and granularity of data.
- **Stakeholders**: May or may not use the dashboard but influence its purpose, priorities, and success metrics.

### **Overlap**:
Sometimes, stakeholders can also be users, especially in smaller organizations or projects where decision-makers actively interact with the dashboard.

By identifying and understanding these groups, you can ensure the dashboard meets the functional needs of users while aligning with the strategic vision of stakeholders.
