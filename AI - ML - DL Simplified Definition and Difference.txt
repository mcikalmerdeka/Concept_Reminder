Here's a simplified version that focuses on the key differences between AI, ML, and DL:

1. AI (Artificial Intelligence):
   - Broadest term
   - Goal: Create systems that mimic human intelligence
   - Includes both rule-based and learning-based approaches
   - Encompasses ML and DL, plus other techniques (e.g., expert systems, robotics)

2. ML (Machine Learning):
   - Subset of AI
   - Focus: Algorithms that improve through experience with data
   - Learns patterns without explicit programming
   - Includes various techniques (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines)
   - DL is one type of ML

3. DL (Deep Learning):
   - Specialized subset of ML
   - Based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers
   - Automatically learns hierarchical feature representations
   - Particularly effective for complex tasks like image and speech recognition
   - Inspired by biological neural networks, but with significant differences

Key Distinctions:
- AI is the overall field, ML is a approach within AI, and DL is a specific technique within ML
- AI can include non-learning systems; ML always involves learning from data
- DL uses a specific structure (deep neural networks) that sets it apart from other ML techniques

A little bit details added :

Here's a revised version of the original answer, incorporating more detailed explanations of AI, ML, and DL:

AI, ML, and DL are related but distinct concepts in the field of artificial intelligence:

1. AI (Artificial Intelligence):
   - The broadest term, encompassing techniques that enable computers to mimic human intelligence.
   - Includes various approaches such as rule-based systems, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
   - Can be narrow (designed for specific tasks) or general (hypothetical systems with human-like general intelligence).
   - Draws from multiple disciplines including computer science, cognitive science, and linguistics.

2. ML (Machine Learning):
   - A subset of AI focused on algorithms and statistical models that improve through experience.
   - Key components include data, features, algorithms, and models.
   - Main categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
   - Uses techniques like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.
   - Applications include recommendation systems, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance.

3. DL (Deep Learning):
   - A specialized subset of ML based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers.
   - Inspired by, but not directly mimicking, the structure and function of biological neural networks.
   - Uses hierarchical layers of processing to extract increasingly complex features from raw input.
   - Particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and complex pattern recognition.
   - While inspired by the brain, it differs in scale, architecture, learning process, and energy efficiency.

In summary: AI is the overarching field encompassing various approaches to create intelligent systems. ML is a subset of AI that focuses on learning from data to improve performance on specific tasks. DL is a specialized form of ML using deep neural networks, inspired by biological neural processing but with significant differences.
