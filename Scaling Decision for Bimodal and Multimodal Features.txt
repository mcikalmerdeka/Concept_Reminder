Ah, you make a very good point! No, we should not scale binary (0/1) variables like the campaign acceptance features. Looking at their distributions in the plots, they are clearly binary categorical variables representing "yes/no" outcomes. Scaling these would not make sense and could potentially harm the model's interpretation of these features.

Let me revise the scaling function:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

def scale_features(df):
    """
    Scale features using appropriate scaling methods based on their distributions
    
    Parameters:
    df: Input DataFrame with features to be scaled
    
    Returns:
    DataFrame: Scaled features in a DataFrame with the same structure
    dict: Fitted scalers for future use
    """
    # Create copies to avoid modifying original data
    df_preprocessed = df.copy()
    
    # Initialize scalers
    robust_scaler = RobustScaler(quantile_range=(5, 95))
    standard_scaler = StandardScaler()
    minmax_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    
    # Monetary features (highly skewed with long tails) - RobustScaler
    monetary_features = [
        'Income',
        'MntWines',
        'MntFruits',
        'MntMeatProducts',
        'MntFishProducts',
        'MntSweetProducts',
        'MntGoldProds',
        'Total_Spending'
    ]
    
    # Count features (discrete, bounded) - MinMaxScaler
    count_features = [
        'NumWebVisitsMonth',
        'NumDealsPurchases',
        'NumWebPurchases',
        'NumCatalogPurchases',
        'NumStorePurchases'
    ]
    
    # Features with more normal-like distributions - StandardScaler
    standard_features = [
        'Age',
        'Recency'
    ]
    
    # Features to skip scaling:
    # Binary categorical:
    # - AcceptedCmp1, AcceptedCmp2, AcceptedCmp3, AcceptedCmp4, AcceptedCmp5
    # - Response
    # - Complain
    # Other categorical/ordinal:
    # - Marital_Status
    # - Education
    # - Num_Child (bimodal, categorical-like)
    # - Membership_Duration (multimodal)
    
    # Scale monetary features
    if monetary_features:
        df_preprocessed[monetary_features] = robust_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[monetary_features])
    
    # Scale count-based features
    if count_features:
        df_preprocessed[count_features] = minmax_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[count_features])
    
    # Scale normally distributed features
    if standard_features:
        df_preprocessed[standard_features] = standard_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[standard_features])
    
    # Store fitted scalers for future use
    scalers = {
        'robust': robust_scaler,
        'minmax': minmax_scaler,
        'standard': standard_scaler
    }
    
    return df_preprocessed, scalers

```

Key changes:
1. Removed all binary categorical variables (AcceptedCmp1-5, Response, Complain) from scaling
2. Kept them in the comments section to document what features are intentionally not scaled
3. Maintained the other changes from before regarding monetary, count, and standard features

These binary variables should be left as is (0 and 1) since:
- They are already effectively encoded
- Scaling would distort their binary nature
- Their interpretation is clear and meaningful as is
- Many machine learning algorithms are designed to work directly with binary features

-----------------------------------------------------------

For multi-modal variables with discrete values like 0,1,2, the decision to scale depends on how the values should be interpreted. Let me explain:

1. If the values represent ordered categories (ordinal) like:
- Education level (0=Basic, 1=High School, 2=University)
- Satisfaction levels (0=Low, 1=Medium, 2=High)
Then these typically shouldn't be scaled as the distances between values have meaning.

2. If the values represent actual counts or continuous measures that happen to show multiple modes, like:
- Number of purchases (0,1,2,3...)
- Time periods that naturally cluster
Then scaling can be appropriate.

Looking at your distributions:
- Num_Child shows clear discrete values (0,1,2,3) and appears categorical in nature - better not to scale
- Membership_Duration shows multiple modes but represents actual time periods - could be scaled
- NumWebVisitsMonth, NumDealsPurchases etc. are true count variables despite having modes - should be scaled

Let me revise the code to reflect this logic:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

def scale_features(df):
    """
    Scale features using appropriate scaling methods based on their distributions
    
    Parameters:
    df: Input DataFrame with features to be scaled
    
    Returns:
    DataFrame: Scaled features in a DataFrame with the same structure
    dict: Fitted scalers for future use
    """
    # Create copies to avoid modifying original data
    df_preprocessed = df.copy()
    
    # Initialize scalers
    robust_scaler = RobustScaler(quantile_range=(5, 95))
    standard_scaler = StandardScaler()
    minmax_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    
    # Monetary features (highly skewed with long tails) - RobustScaler
    monetary_features = [
        'Income',
        'MntWines',
        'MntFruits',
        'MntMeatProducts',
        'MntFishProducts',
        'MntSweetProducts',
        'MntGoldProds',
        'Total_Spending'
    ]
    
    # Count features (discrete but representing actual quantities) - MinMaxScaler
    count_features = [
        'NumWebVisitsMonth',
        'NumDealsPurchases',
        'NumWebPurchases',
        'NumCatalogPurchases',
        'NumStorePurchases'
    ]
    
    # Features with more normal-like distributions - StandardScaler
    standard_features = [
        'Age',
        'Recency',
        'Membership_Duration'  # Though multimodal, it represents actual time periods
    ]
    
    # Features to skip scaling:
    # Binary categorical (0/1):
    # - AcceptedCmp1, AcceptedCmp2, AcceptedCmp3, AcceptedCmp4, AcceptedCmp5
    # - Response
    # - Complain
    # Multi-modal categorical/ordinal:
    # - Marital_Status
    # - Education
    # - Num_Child (discrete values 0,1,2,3 representing categories)
    
    # Scale monetary features
    if monetary_features:
        df_preprocessed[monetary_features] = robust_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[monetary_features])
    
    # Scale count-based features
    if count_features:
        df_preprocessed[count_features] = minmax_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[count_features])
    
    # Scale normally distributed features
    if standard_features:
        df_preprocessed[standard_features] = standard_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[standard_features])
    
    # Store fitted scalers for future use
    scalers = {
        'robust': robust_scaler,
        'minmax': minmax_scaler,
        'standard': standard_scaler
    }
    
    return df_preprocessed, scalers

```

Key considerations for multi-modal variables:

1. Don't scale if:
- The values represent distinct categories
- The gaps between values have specific meaning
- The variable is ordinal in nature
- Example: Num_Child (0,1,2,3 representing actual number of children)

2. Do scale if:
- The values represent continuous quantities
- The multiple modes are just natural clusters in the data
- The variable could theoretically take any value
- Example: Membership_Duration (represents actual time periods)

3. The choice also depends on your model:
- Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) don't require scaling of ordinal variables
- Neural Networks and distance-based models (KNN, SVM) might benefit from scaling even ordinal variables

Ah, you're absolutely right! I apologize for any confusion. One-hot encoded variables (like the marital status columns in your plots) should NEVER be scaled because:

1. They are already binary (0/1) indicators
2. Scaling would distort their meaning as dummy variables
3. Each column represents presence/absence of a category
4. The values are already in the optimal format for most machine learning algorithms

Looking at your distribution plots, I can see the marital status has been split into separate columns (like Marital_Status_Single, Marital_Status_Married, etc.) with binary distributions. Let me revise the code one more time:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

def scale_features(df):
    """
    Scale features using appropriate scaling methods based on their distributions
    
    Parameters:
    df: Input DataFrame with features to be scaled
    
    Returns:

    dict: Fitted scalers for future use
    """
    # Create copies to avoid modifying original data
    df_preprocessed = df.copy()
    
    # Initialize scalers

    standard_scaler = StandardScaler()
    minmax_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    
    # Monetary features (highly skewed with long tails) - RobustScaler
    monetary_features = [
        'Income',
        'MntWines',
        'MntFruits',
        'MntMeatProducts',
        'MntFishProducts',
        'MntSweetProducts',
        'MntGoldProds',
        'Total_Spending'
    ]
    
    # Count features (discrete but representing actual quantities) - MinMaxScaler
    count_features = [
        'NumWebVisitsMonth',
        'NumDealsPurchases',

    standard_features = [
        'Age',
        'Recency',
        'Membership_Duration'  # Though multimodal, it represents actual time periods
    ]
    
    # Features to skip scaling:
    # Binary features (0/1):
    # - All one-hot encoded Marital_Status_* columns
    # - AcceptedCmp1, AcceptedCmp2, AcceptedCmp3, AcceptedCmp4, AcceptedCmp5
    # - Response
    # - Complain
    # Multi-modal categorical/ordinal:
    # - Education (if not one-hot encoded)
    # - Num_Child (discrete values 0,1,2,3 representing categories)
    
    # Scale monetary features
    if monetary_features:
        df_preprocessed[monetary_features] = robust_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[monetary_features])
    
    # Scale count-based features
    if count_features:
        df_preprocessed[count_features] = minmax_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[count_features])
    
    # Scale normally distributed features
    if standard_features:
        df_preprocessed[standard_features] = standard_scaler.fit_transform(df_preprocessed[standard_features])
    
    # Store fitted scalers for future use
    scalers = {
        'robust': robust_scaler,
        'minmax': minmax_scaler,
        'standard': standard_scaler
    }
    
    return df_preprocessed, scalers

```

Key points about one-hot encoded variables:
1. They should be kept as is (0/1)
2. They're already in the optimal format for modeling
3. They'll be used in modeling but don't need scaling
4. This applies to all dummy variables created through one-hot encoding

For your dataset, this means:
- Keep all Marital_Status_* columns as binary (0/1)
- If Education is also one-hot encoded, those columns should also remain as binary
- Use them directly in modeling without scaling
