how can i make an accumulated column values in python and sql? can you give me example data and code? 


To create an accumulated (running total) column in Python and SQL, here are examples with code and data:

---

### **Example Data**
Assume a table `sales` with the following data:

| date       | amount |
|------------|--------|
| 2023-01-01 | 100    |
| 2023-01-02 | 200    |
| 2023-01-03 | 150    |
| 2023-01-04 | 300    |

---

## **1. Python (Using Pandas)**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
data = {
    'date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03', '2023-01-04'],
    'amount': [100, 200, 150, 300]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Sort by date (if not already sorted)
df = df.sort_values(by='date')

# Create accumulated column
df['accumulated'] = df['amount'].cumsum()

# Result
print(df)
```

**Output:**
```
         date  amount  accumulated
0  2023-01-01     100          100
1  2023-01-02     200          300
2  2023-01-03     150          450
3  2023-01-04     300          750
```

---

## **2. SQL (Using Window Functions)**
```sql
-- Create and populate the table
CREATE TABLE sales (
    date DATE,
    amount INT
);

INSERT INTO sales (date, amount)
VALUES
    ('2023-01-01', 100),
    ('2023-01-02', 200),
    ('2023-01-03', 150),
    ('2023-01-04', 300);

-- Query to compute accumulated amount
SELECT
    date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS accumulated
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    date;
```

**Result:**
```
date        | amount | accumulated
------------|--------|------------
2023-01-01  | 100    | 100
2023-01-02  | 200    | 300
2023-01-03  | 150    | 450
2023-01-04  | 300    | 750
```

---

### **Key Notes**:
- **Python**: Use `cumsum()` from Pandas to compute the running total.
- **SQL**: Use the `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY ...)` window function.
- Ensure the data is sorted (e.g., by date) before computing the accumulated value.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

are there other useful window functionality that can be applied in pyhton and sql? can you also give example code for those? 

Absolutely! Window functions are powerful for analytics. Here are key functionalities with examples in **Python (Pandas)** and **SQL**:

---

### **1. **ROW_NUMBER()**  
Assign a unique row number within a partition.

#### **SQL**:
```sql
SELECT
  date,
  amount,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY date) AS row_num
FROM sales;
```

#### **Python**:
```python
df['row_num'] = df.sort_values('date').cumcount() + 1
```

---

### **2. **RANK() / DENSE_RANK()**  
Rank rows with gaps (RANK) or without gaps (DENSE_RANK) for ties.

#### **SQL**:
```sql
SELECT
  date,
  amount,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rank,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM sales;
```

#### **Python**:
```python
df['rank'] = df['amount'].rank(ascending=False, method='min').astype(int)
df['dense_rank'] = df['amount'].rank(ascending=False, method='dense').astype(int)
```

---

### **3. **LAG() / LEAD()**  
Access previous or next row values.

#### **SQL**:
```sql
SELECT
  date,
  amount,
  LAG(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS prev_amount,
  LEAD(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS next_amount
FROM sales;
```

#### **Python**:
```python
df['prev_amount'] = df['amount'].shift(1)
df['next_amount'] = df['amount'].shift(-1)
```

---

### **4. **PARTITION BY**  
Compute values within groups (e.g., running total per category).

#### **SQL**:
```sql
-- Example: Add a "category" column
SELECT
  date,
  category,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY date) AS accumulated_by_category
FROM sales;
```

#### **Python**:
```python
df['accumulated_by_category'] = df.groupby('category')['amount'].cumsum()
```

---

### **5. **Moving Average**  
Calculate rolling averages (e.g., 3-day moving average).

#### **SQL**:
```sql
SELECT
  date,
  amount,
  AVG(amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS moving_avg_3day
FROM sales;
```

#### **Python**:
```python
df['moving_avg_3day'] = df['amount'].rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()
```

---

### **6. **FIRST_VALUE() / LAST_VALUE()**  
Get the first or last value in a window.

#### **SQL**:
```sql
SELECT
  date,
  amount,
  FIRST_VALUE(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS first_amount,
  LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS last_amount
FROM sales;
```

#### **Python**:
```python
df['first_amount'] = df['amount'].iloc[0]
df['last_amount'] = df['amount'].iloc[-1]
```

---

### **7. **NTILE()**  
Divide rows into buckets (e.g., quartiles).

#### **SQL**:
```sql
SELECT
  date,
  amount,
  NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY amount) AS quartile
FROM sales;
```

#### **Python**:
```python
df['quartile'] = pd.qcut(df['amount'], q=4, labels=False) + 1
```

---

### **Example Data Output (SQL Moving Average)**:
| date       | amount | moving_avg_3day |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2023-01-01 | 100    | 100.0           |
| 2023-01-02 | 200    | 150.0           |
| 2023-01-03 | 150    | 150.0           |
| 2023-01-04 | 300    | 216.7           |

---

### **Key Notes**:
- **SQL**: Use `OVER()` with clauses like `PARTITION BY`, `ORDER BY`, and frame specifications (`ROWS BETWEEN`).
- **Python**: Leverage Pandas methods like `groupby()`, `rolling()`, `rank()`, and `shift()`.
- Always sort data explicitly in both SQL and Pandas for accurate results.

give me several more examples, make it as complete and as many as you can


Here’s a **comprehensive list** of window function examples in SQL and Python (Pandas), covering a wide range of use cases:

---

### **1. **PERCENT_RANK()**  
Calculates the relative percentile rank of a row (0 to 1).  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount) AS percent_rank 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['percent_rank'] = df['amount'].rank(pct=True)
```  

---

### **2. **CUME_DIST()**  
Computes the cumulative distribution (proportion of rows ≤ current value).  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY amount) AS cume_dist 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['cume_dist'] = df['amount'].expanding().apply(lambda x: (x <= x[-1]).mean())
```

---

### **3. **NTH_VALUE()**  
Retrieves the value of the *n*-th row in the window.  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  NTH_VALUE(amount, 2) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS second_value 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['second_value'] = df['amount'].shift(1)  # Equivalent to 2nd row
```

---

### **4. **COUNT() as a Window Function**  
Running count of rows.  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  COUNT(*) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS running_count 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['running_count'] = df['date'].expanding().count()
```

---

### **5. **Cumulative Product**  
Track the product of values over time.  
**SQL** (Workaround using logs):  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  EXP(SUM(LN(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY date)) AS cumulative_product 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['cumulative_product'] = df['amount'].cumprod()
```

---

### **6. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
Weighted average favoring recent data.  
**SQL** (Not straightforward; use recursive CTE or Python):  
**Python**:  
```python
df['ema'] = df['amount'].ewm(alpha=0.3, adjust=False).mean()
```

---

### **7. **Cumulative Maximum**  
Track the maximum value up to the current row.  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  MAX(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS cumulative_max 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['cumulative_max'] = df['amount'].cummax()
```

---

### **8. **Difference from Previous Row**  
Calculate change between consecutive rows.  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  amount - LAG(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS diff_prev 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['diff_prev'] = df['amount'].diff()
```

---

### **9. **Percentage of Total**  
Compute a row’s contribution to the total.  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  amount * 100.0 / SUM(amount) OVER () AS percent_total 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['percent_total'] = df['amount'] / df['amount'].sum() * 100
```

---

### **10. **ROWS vs RANGE Frames**  
- **ROWS**: Physical rows.  
- **RANGE**: Logical groups (e.g., dates with duplicates).  
**SQL**:  
```sql
-- ROWS example (3 preceding rows):
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS 3 PRECEDING) 
FROM sales;

-- RANGE example (values within 50 units):
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY amount RANGE BETWEEN 50 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python** (ROWS equivalent):  
```python
df['moving_avg_3row'] = df['amount'].rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()
```

---

### **11. **GROUPS Frame**  
Group rows into buckets (e.g., every 2 groups).  
**SQL** (PostgreSQL):  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date GROUPS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) 
FROM sales;
```

---

### **12. **Multiple Partition Columns**  
Partition by multiple columns.  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  category, 
  region, 
  SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY category, region ORDER BY date) 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['sum_partitioned'] = df.groupby(['category', 'region'])['amount'].cumsum()
```

---

### **13. **Statistical Functions (STDDEV, VARIANCE)**  
Compute rolling statistics.  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  STDDEV(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS rolling_stddev 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['rolling_stddev'] = df['amount'].rolling(window=3).std()
```

---

### **14. **Expanding Window**  
Calculate metrics from the start to the current row.  
**SQL**:  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  amount, 
  AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['expanding_avg'] = df['amount'].expanding().mean()
```

---

### **15. **Handling Ties in RANK()**  
Control tie behavior with `method` in Pandas.  
**Python**:  
```python
# 'min' vs 'dense' vs 'average'
df['rank_min'] = df['amount'].rank(method='min')
df['rank_dense'] = df['amount'].rank(method='dense')
```

---

### **16. **First/Last Non-Null Value**  
Use `IGNORE NULLS` in SQL or `ffill/bfill` in Python.  
**SQL** (e.g., BigQuery):  
```sql
SELECT 
  date, 
  LAST_VALUE(amount IGNORE NULLS) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS last_non_null 
FROM sales;
```  
**Python**:  
```python
df['last_non_null'] = df['amount'].ffill()
```

---

### **Example Output (Percentage of Total)**  
| date       | amount | percent_total |  
|------------|--------|---------------|  
| 2023-01-01 | 100    | 13.3%         |  
| 2023-01-02 | 200    | 26.7%         |  
| 2023-01-03 | 150    | 20.0%         |  
| 2023-01-04 | 300    | 40.0%         |  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. **SQL**: Use `OVER()`, `PARTITION BY`, and frame clauses (`ROWS`, `RANGE`, `GROUPS`) for advanced analytics.  
2. **Python**: Leverage Pandas’ `.groupby()`, `.rolling()`, `.expanding()`, and `.ewm()` for similar logic.  
3. **Performance**: Window functions can be resource-heavy—partition wisely and avoid unnecessary sorting.
