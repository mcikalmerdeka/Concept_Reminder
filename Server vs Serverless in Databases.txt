what does serverless means? for example i am creating tables in pgadmin in my local postgres, does that means i am running it with server? what does server here even means


Great question — this is a common point of confusion.

### ✅ What "server" means in databases:

In the context of databases, a **server** is a background program (called a **database server**) that **runs continuously**, listens for requests, and handles database operations.

For example:

- **PostgreSQL** is a **server-based** database.
- When you install PostgreSQL locally, it **starts a PostgreSQL server process**.
- Then, tools like **pgAdmin**, **psql**, or your app **connect to that server** to send SQL commands.
- The server handles connections, permissions, transactions, and more.

Even if everything is on **your own laptop**, PostgreSQL is **still running as a server**, because:
> Your client tools (like pgAdmin) talk to a **PostgreSQL server process** running in the background, typically on `localhost` (your own machine).

### ✅ What "serverless" means in this context:

"Serverless" in databases (not cloud/serverless computing) just means:
> 🟢 You **don't need to run a background server process**. You just read/write the database file directly.

#### Example: **SQLite**

- There's no `sqlite3-server` running in the background.
- When your app or script opens the `.sqlite` or `.db` file, it just uses a **library** to read/write that file directly.
- It’s "serverless" because it **doesn’t require a server to manage access** — everything is in-process.

### 🔁 Summary comparison:

| Feature                  | PostgreSQL (and MySQL) | SQLite                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Requires server process? | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                      |
| Connection via client?   | ✅ Yes (e.g., pgAdmin) | ❌ Direct file access      |
| Use case                 | Multi-user, complex    | Lightweight, single-user   |

So yes — if you're using **pgAdmin**, even locally, you're connecting to a **PostgreSQL server** that’s running on your machine in the background. Can be checked using task manager or other method.
