The R2 score, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that is predictable from the independent variables (features) in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit and 0 indicates no linear relationship between the predictors and the target variable.

The formula for the R2 score is:

\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} \]

Where:
- \( SS_{res} \) is the sum of squared residuals (or errors) of the model.
- \( SS_{tot} \) is the total sum of squares, which represents the total variance in the dependent variable.


Sure, let me break down what \( SS_{res} \) and \( SS_{tot} \) represent:

1. \( SS_{res} \) (Sum of Squared Residuals): This term represents the sum of the squared differences between the actual observed values of the dependent variable and the predicted values by the regression model. It quantifies the total unexplained variance by the model.

2. \( SS_{tot} \) (Total Sum of Squares): This term represents the sum of the squared differences between the actual observed values of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable. It quantifies the total variance in the dependent variable without considering any predictors.

The \( R^2 \) score essentially compares the amount of variance explained by the model (captured by \( SS_{res} \)) to the total variance in the dependent variable (captured by \( SS_{tot} \)).


Variance and standard deviation are both measures of the spread or dispersion of a dataset, but they differ in their units of measurement and interpretation:

1. Variance:
   - Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.
   - It measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean of the dataset.
   - Since it involves squared differences, the units of variance are squared units of the original data.

2. Standard Deviation:
   - Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
   - It measures the average deviation of each data point from the mean of the dataset.
   - Standard deviation provides a measure of dispersion that is in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable compared to variance.

In summary, variance provides a measure of the overall variability in the dataset, while standard deviation gives a more intuitive measure of how spread out the values are from the mean.
