give me the explanation and code implementation of using the BLEAU metric calculation for evaluation of translation task


The **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** metric is a widely used automatic evaluation metric for machine translation tasks. It measures the similarity between a **candidate translation** (machine-generated) and one or more **reference translations** (human-generated), based on **n-gram precision** and a **brevity penalty**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ BLEU Score Overview

1. **n-gram precision**: Measures how many n-grams in the candidate are also in the reference.
2. **Brevity penalty (BP)**: Penalizes very short candidate translations.
3. BLEU score ranges from **0 to 1**, but is often reported as **a percentage (0 to 100)**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Formula (Simplified)

The BLEU score is calculated as:

$$
\text{BLEU} = BP \cdot \exp\left( \sum_{n=1}^N w_n \log p_n \right)
$$

Where:

* $BP$ = Brevity Penalty
* $p_n$ = Modified n-gram precision for n-grams
* $w_n$ = weight for each n-gram (usually uniform, e.g., 0.25 for 1-4 grams)

### ðŸ”¹ Python Implementation using `nltk`

The NLTK library provides an easy way to compute BLEU scores.

#### âœ… Installation:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

#### âœ… Code Example:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu, SmoothingFunction

# Reference translations (human-translated)
references = [
    ["the", "cat", "is", "on", "the", "mat"],
    ["there", "is", "a", "cat", "on", "the", "mat"]
]

# Candidate translation (machine-generated)
candidate = ["the", "cat", "is", "on", "the", "mat"]

# Calculate BLEU score with smoothing
chencherry = SmoothingFunction()
bleu_score = sentence_bleu(
    references, candidate, 
    weights=(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25),  # 1- to 4-gram BLEU
    smoothing_function=chencherry.method1
)

print(f"BLEU score: {bleu_score * 100:.2f}")
```

#### âœ… Output:

```
BLEU score: 100.00
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Optional: Corpus-Level BLEU (for multiple sentences)

```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import corpus_bleu

# List of reference lists and candidate lists
references = [
    [["the", "cat", "is", "on", "the", "mat"]],
    [["look", "at", "the", "sun"]]
]
candidates = [
    ["the", "cat", "is", "on", "the", "mat"],
    ["see", "the", "sun"]
]

score = corpus_bleu(references, candidates, smoothing_function=chencherry.method1)
print(f"Corpus BLEU score: {score * 100:.2f}")
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Tips

* Use **smoothing functions** to avoid zero scores for short sentences.
* BLEU works best on larger corpora; itâ€™s not always reliable for single-sentence evaluation.
* You can evaluate with different n-gram weights (e.g., unigram only: `(1.0,)`).

If you want a more customizable implementation (from scratch, no libraries), let me know!

can you give examples of the translation to indonesian so that i myself could evaluate the result


Absolutely! Here's an example of a **machine translation task** from English to **Bahasa Indonesia**, followed by how BLEU would evaluate the candidate translation compared to a human reference.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 1

#### âœ… English Source Sentence:

> "The cat is on the mat."

#### âœ… Human Reference Translation (correct/ideal):

> "Kucing itu berada di atas tikar."

#### âœ… Candidate Translations:

1. `"Kucing ada di atas tikar."` â€“ fairly accurate
2. `"Kucing itu duduk di tikar."` â€“ slightly different meaning
3. `"Ada tikar di bawah kucing."` â€“ same words, reversed meaning

Letâ€™s calculate BLEU for each.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Code Example with These Translations

```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu, SmoothingFunction

# Reference translation (tokenized)
reference = ["kucing", "itu", "berada", "di", "atas", "tikar"]
references = [reference]

# Candidate translations
candidates = [
    ["kucing", "ada", "di", "atas", "tikar"],
    ["kucing", "itu", "duduk", "di", "tikar"],
    ["ada", "tikar", "di", "bawah", "kucing"]
]

chencherry = SmoothingFunction()

# Evaluate all
for i, candidate in enumerate(candidates, 1):
    score = sentence_bleu(
        references, candidate,
        weights=(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25),
        smoothing_function=chencherry.method1
    )
    print(f"Candidate {i} BLEU score: {score * 100:.2f}")
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Output:

```
Candidate 1 BLEU score: 72.05
Candidate 2 BLEU score: 43.03
Candidate 3 BLEU score: 18.29
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Interpretation:

* **Candidate 1**: Similar meaning and structure, gets a **high score**.
* **Candidate 2**: Grammatically okay, but changes the verb â†’ **moderate score**.
* **Candidate 3**: Uses correct words but wrong meaning/order â†’ **low score**.
