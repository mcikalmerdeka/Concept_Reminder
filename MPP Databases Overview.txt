**Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)** databases are designed to scale out by distributing data and processing across many nodes in a cluster, each with its own CPU and memory. They are particularly useful for **analytics on large-scale data**, as they enable parallel query execution.

### âœ… Examples of MPP Databases

| MPP Database                                  | Description                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon Redshift**                           | Cloud-native MPP DB based on ParAccel; highly integrated with AWS.                  |
| **Google BigQuery**                           | Serverless MPP-like system built on Dremel and Colossus; abstracts compute/storage. |
| **Snowflake**                                 | Cloud-native MPP architecture with decoupled compute and storage.                   |
| **Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL DW)** | Microsoftâ€™s MPP cloud solution integrated with Azure.                               |
| **Greenplum**                                 | Open-source MPP DB based on PostgreSQL; widely used in on-prem environments.        |
| **Vertica**                                   | High-performance analytics MPP DB developed by HP (originally by Vertica Systems).  |
| **Teradata**                                  | Enterprise-grade, on-prem/cloud MPP platform for complex analytics.                 |
| **Netezza (IBM Db2 Warehouse)**               | MPP appliance/database acquired by IBM.                                             |

### ðŸ§  Are Modern Databases Based on the MPP Concept?

Yes â€” **modern analytical databases**, especially cloud-based ones, are heavily inspired by or directly implement MPP architecture:

* **Cloud-first data warehouses** like **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, and **Redshift** are **inherently MPP systems**.
* They scale horizontally, meaning performance increases by adding nodes.
* **Separation of compute and storage** (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) is a modern evolution of MPP ideas.
* **Distributed SQL engines** like **Databricks SQL**, **ClickHouse**, and **Trino (PrestoSQL)** also borrow MPP concepts even if not strictly MPP.

### ðŸ†š MPP vs Traditional RDBMS

| Feature      | MPP                         | Traditional RDBMS              |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Scale**    | Horizontal (add nodes)      | Vertical (scale up)            |
| **Use Case** | Analytical workloads (OLAP) | Transactional workloads (OLTP) |
| **Examples** | Redshift, BigQuery          | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle      |

---

### Summary

* MPP systems **dominate the modern data analytics landscape**, especially in cloud data warehouses.
* They are **not ideal for transactional workloads**, but **excellent for big data analytics**.
* Most new **modern analytical databases are designed with MPP principles in mind** to scale efficiently and process large data volumes in parallel.
