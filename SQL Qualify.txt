The QUALIFY clause is indeed not a standard SQL feature and is not supported by every database system. It's primarily used in some analytical databases like Teradata, Snowflake, and Google BigQuery. The QUALIFY clause is used to filter the results of window functions, allowing you to apply conditions to the output of these functions.

Here's an example of how you might use the QUALIFY clause:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department,
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM 
    employees
QUALIFY 
    salary_rank <= 3;
```

In this example:

1. We're selecting employee information including their department and salary.
2. We're using the ROW_NUMBER() window function to rank employees within each department based on their salary (highest to lowest).
3. The QUALIFY clause is then used to filter the results, keeping only the top 3 highest-paid employees in each department.

The QUALIFY clause is particularly useful because it allows you to filter on the results of window functions without needing to use a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression). This can make queries more concise and potentially more efficient.

Without QUALIFY, you might need to write the same query like this:

```sql
WITH ranked_employees AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        department,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM 
        employees
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_employees
WHERE salary_rank <= 3;
```

The QUALIFY clause simplifies this by allowing you to apply the filter directly in the main query.

Remember, since this isn't a standard SQL feature, you'll need to check whether your specific database system supports it before using it in your queries.

Certainly, I'd be happy to provide more examples of the QUALIFY clause with explanations. Here are a few different scenarios where QUALIFY can be useful:

1. Finding the latest record for each category:

```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    product_name,
    update_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY update_date DESC) AS rn
FROM 
    products
QUALIFY 
    rn = 1;
```

Explanation: This query selects the most recently updated product for each category. The QUALIFY clause filters out all but the latest record (where row number = 1) for each category.

2. Identifying outliers based on z-score:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,
    price,
    AVG(price) OVER () AS avg_price,
    STDDEV(price) OVER () AS stddev_price,
    (price - AVG(price) OVER ()) / STDDEV(price) OVER () AS z_score
FROM 
    products
QUALIFY 
    ABS(z_score) > 2;
```

Explanation: This query calculates the z-score for each product's price and then uses QUALIFY to filter for products with a z-score greater than 2 or less than -2, effectively identifying price outliers.

3. Getting the top N percent of values:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    salary,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_percentile
FROM 
    employees
QUALIFY 
    salary_percentile <= 0.1;
```

Explanation: This query ranks employees by salary and uses QUALIFY to filter for the top 10% of salaries (those with a percent rank of 0.1 or less).

4. Finding cumulative sum breakpoints:

```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    order_amount,
    SUM(order_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM 
    orders
QUALIFY 
    running_total > 1000000 AND 
    LAG(running_total) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) <= 1000000;
```

Explanation: This query calculates a running total of order amounts and uses QUALIFY to identify the exact point where the cumulative sum exceeds 1 million for the first time.

5. Identifying streak starts and ends:

```sql
SELECT 
    game_date,
    result,
    SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'WIN' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (ORDER BY game_date) AS win_streak,
    LAG(result) OVER (ORDER BY game_date) AS prev_result
FROM 
    game_results
QUALIFY 
    (result = 'WIN' AND prev_result = 'LOSS') OR (result = 'LOSS' AND prev_result = 'WIN') OR prev_result IS NULL;
```

Explanation: This query identifies the start and end of winning streaks in a series of game results. The QUALIFY clause filters for rows where the result changes from a loss to a win (start of streak) or from a win to a loss (end of streak), as well as the very first game.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the QUALIFY clause in analytical queries. It's particularly powerful for scenarios involving window functions and complex filtering based on calculated values. Remember that the syntax and availability of QUALIFY can vary between database systems that support it.
