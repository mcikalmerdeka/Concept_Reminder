Sure, here is a clear comparison between ARIMA and machine learning methods that highlights why ARIMA is generally not considered a machine learning algorithm:

### 1. Foundation and Methodology
**ARIMA**:
- **Statistical Basis**: Relies on traditional statistical techniques.
- **Model Structure**: Composed of three components - Autoregressive (AR), Integrated (I), and Moving Average (MA).
- **Parameter Estimation**: Uses maximum likelihood estimation or least squares.

**Machine Learning**:
- **Computational Basis**: Involves algorithms that learn patterns from data.
- **Model Structure**: Includes a wide range of models like decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, etc.
- **Parameter Estimation**: Uses optimization algorithms to minimize a cost function, often involving iterative processes.

### 2. Data Handling
**ARIMA**:
- **Assumptions**: Assumes data is stationary or can be made stationary.
- **Dependence on Past Values**: Directly models the time series using past values and errors.

**Machine Learning**:
- **Flexibility**: Can handle non-stationary data without needing it to be transformed to stationary.
- **Feature Engineering**: Can incorporate a variety of features, not just past values of the series.

### 3. Model Complexity
**ARIMA**:
- **Simplicity**: Models are relatively simple and interpretable.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Involves selecting p (autoregressive order), d (differencing order), and q (moving average order).

**Machine Learning**:
- **Complexity**: Models can range from simple (linear regression) to highly complex (deep learning networks).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Often involves tuning many hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.

### 4. Learning Mechanism
**ARIMA**:
- **Static Model**: Once fitted, the model parameters remain fixed unless the model is re-estimated with new data.
- **No Continuous Learning**: Does not continuously update with new data.

**Machine Learning**:
- **Dynamic Model**: Models can be retrained regularly with new data.
- **Continuous Learning**: Some models, especially online learning algorithms, can continuously update as new data comes in.

### 5. Model Application and Flexibility
**ARIMA**:
- **Specialized**: Primarily designed for univariate time series forecasting.
- **Limited Scope**: Not typically used for other types of data or tasks.

**Machine Learning**:
- **Versatile**: Can be applied to a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, clustering, and more.
- **Broader Applications**: Used in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

### Summary

- **ARIMA** is a traditional statistical approach specifically designed for time series forecasting, with a focus on past values and errors, and a requirement for stationarity.
- **Machine Learning** encompasses a broader range of techniques that learn from data, can handle complex and non-linear patterns, and are applicable to various data types and problems beyond time series.

This comparison underscores why ARIMA is considered a statistical method rather than a machine learning algorithm: it lacks the adaptive, learning-based approach characteristic of machine learning models.
