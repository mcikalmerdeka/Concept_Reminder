does split terminal in vscode actually created a new terminal where i can run my process?

Yes, when you split the terminal in **VS Code**, it creates a **new, independent terminal instance** where you can run separate processes. Each split terminal operates independently, with its own shell session, environment, and command history. Here's how it works:

### Key Features of Split Terminals:
1. **Independent Processes**:
   - Each split terminal runs in its own shell (e.g., PowerShell, bash, zsh, etc.).
   - You can run different commands or processes in each split (e.g., a server in one and a build script in another).

2. **Visual Layout**:
   - Terminals are split horizontally or vertically (right-click the terminal panel or use shortcuts like `Ctrl+\` for vertical splits or `Ctrl+Shift+5` for horizontal splits).
   - You can resize splits by dragging the divider.

3. **Customization**:
   - Each split can use a **different shell type** (e.g., one for WSL and another for PowerShell).
   - You can even navigate to different directories in each split.

### Example Workflow:
1. **Split the Terminal**:
   - Use the **Split Terminal** button (âš¡ icon) or the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+5` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Shift+5` (macOS).
   
2. **Run Commands**:
   - In **Terminal 1**: Run `npm start` (frontend server).
   - In **Terminal 2**: Run `npm run build` (build process).
   - In **Terminal 3**: Run a Python script or Git commands.

### Pro Tips:
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+`` (backtick) to toggle the terminal panel or create a new terminal.
- **Kill Individual Terminals**: Use the trash can icon next to each split to close it.
- **Navigate Between Splits**: Use `Ctrl+PageUp`/`Ctrl+PageDown` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+Left/Right` (macOS).

In summary, **split terminals in VS Code are fully functional, isolated environments**â€”perfect for multitasking without cluttering a single terminal. ðŸš€
