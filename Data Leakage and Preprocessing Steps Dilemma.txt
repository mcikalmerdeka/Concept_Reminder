help me understand the data leakage problem in data science project. let's say the case is default prediction for a bank company. do i directly start with splitting the dataset to train and test set or after i already done the EDA and pre-processing like changing data types, handling missing values, filtering outliers, etc? and also specifically for feature scaling i already know that it needs to be done after we split the dataset

Let me explain data leakage in the context of default prediction and walk through the correct order of operations.

The key principle is: any transformation that uses information from the entire dataset can potentially cause data leakage. Here's how to approach this properly:

1. Initial Split First
You should FIRST split your dataset into train and test sets before doing most preprocessing steps. This is because you want your test set to truly represent "unseen" data.

However, there are some basic data cleaning steps that can be done before splitting:
- Changing data types (e.g., converting strings to datetime)
- Removing duplicate rows
- Fixing obvious data entry errors
- Basic consistency checks

2. After Splitting
These steps should be done AFTER splitting, using ONLY information from the training set:
- Handling missing values (if using mean/median imputation)
- Outlier detection and handling
- Feature scaling/normalization
- Feature engineering
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection

Let me explain why with examples specific to default prediction:

Incorrect Approach (Data Leakage):
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
df['income'].fillna(df['income'].mean())  # Using full dataset mean
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(df)
```

This leaks information about the test set's income distribution into your training data.

Correct Approach:
```python
# DO THIS
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(df)
train_mean = X_train['income'].mean()
X_train['income'].fillna(train_mean)
X_test['income'].fillna(train_mean)  # Use training mean for test set
```

For your specific case of default prediction, here's a practical example of potential leakage:

Let's say you have a feature for "average income in customer's zip code." If you calculate this average using the entire dataset, you're inadvertently including information from customers in your test set, which wouldn't be available in a real-world scenario when predicting defaults for new customers.

You're correct about feature scaling - it must be done after splitting because:
1. The scaler parameters (mean, standard deviation) should be learned only from training data
2. These same parameters are then applied to transform the test set
3. This mimics real-world conditions where you don't have access to future data statistics

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

okay let's break it one by one, first is in the EDA process, what if i need to do some preprocessing like feature engineering to gather new insights? wont i lose some valuable information since i got several chunks of data already in the test set and not in the training data that i did EDA? or the process of focused EDA and pre-processing that focused on creating a machine learning model as an output should be separated ?


This is a great question that touches on a common dilemma in data science workflows! Let me clarify the distinction between exploratory and model-focused preprocessing.

The EDA process can actually be split into two phases:

1. Initial Exploratory EDA
- This is done on the FULL dataset before splitting
- Purpose: Understanding your data, business context, and potential modeling approaches
- Activities allowed:
  - Visualizing distributions
  - Checking correlations
  - Understanding missing value patterns
  - Basic feature engineering for exploration (e.g., creating age from birthdate)
  - Identifying potential issues in the data
  - Formulating hypotheses about useful features

2. Model-Focused Preprocessing
- This is done AFTER train-test split
- Purpose: Preparing features specifically for model training
- Activities:
  - Feature scaling
  - Missing value imputation
  - Outlier handling
  - Feature engineering for model input
  - Feature selection

For your default prediction case, here's how this might look:

```python
# Phase 1: Initial EDA (before split)
# This is fine to do on full dataset
df['age'] = current_year - df['birth_year']
df['debt_to_income'] = df['total_debt'] / df['income']

# Explore relationships
plt.scatter(df['debt_to_income'], df['default'])
plt.title('Debt-to-Income vs Default Rate')

# Phase 2: Model Preprocessing (after split)
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(df)

# Now do model-specific preprocessing on training data only
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)  # only transform, no fit
```

Think of it this way:
- The initial EDA is about understanding your problem and data landscape
- The model-focused preprocessing is about preparing your specific model inputs

You're not losing valuable information by doing this separation because:
1. The insights you gain from full-dataset EDA inform your overall modeling strategy
2. The actual feature engineering for the model is done properly on the training set
3. This approach actually prevents you from overfitting to the test set

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

okay next can you give me a complete breakdown from start to finish with code example of how the example correct flow looks like? because i believe you said before there are some basic preprocessing steps can be done before splitting and several preprocessing steps that should be done after splitting


I'll create a comprehensive example for a default prediction project with the correct sequence of operations.

This code demonstrates the complete workflow with clear separation between what should be done before and after splitting. Let me break down the key phases:

Before Split:
1. Basic Preprocessing
   - Fix data types
   - Remove duplicates
   - Basic feature engineering
   - Fix obvious errors
   - Basic consistency checks

2. Initial EDA
   - Examine distributions
   - Check missing values
   - Look at correlations

After Split:
1. Handle Missing Values
   - Use training data statistics for imputation
   
2. Handle Categorical Variables
   - Fit encoders on training data only

3. Feature Scaling
   - Fit scaler on training data only

4. Advanced Feature Engineering
   - Create new features using only training data

5. Handle Outliers
   - Determine bounds from training data only

The key principle throughout is that any transformation that learns from the data (calculates statistics, determines boundaries, learns encodings) must be fit only on the training data, then applied to both training and test sets.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this workflow in more detail?
