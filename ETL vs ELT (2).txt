Using dbt (data build tool), Airflow, and Snowflake typically follows an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) approach rather than ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). Here's why:

1. Extract: Data is extracted from various source systems.

2. Load: The extracted data is loaded directly into Snowflake (the data warehouse) in its raw form.

3. Transform: Transformations are performed within Snowflake using dbt, which leverages SQL to transform the raw data into analytics-ready models.

Airflow in this setup is usually used for orchestrating the entire process, scheduling jobs, and managing dependencies between tasks.

This approach differs from traditional ETL where data is transformed before being loaded into the target system. ELT takes advantage of the powerful processing capabilities of modern cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, allowing for more flexible and scalable data transformations.

----------------------------------------------------------------

ELT and ETL each have their advantages, and the choice between them often depends on specific use cases and organizational needs. Let me break this down for you:

Advantages of ELT:

1. Flexibility: Raw data is preserved in the data warehouse, allowing for multiple transformations without re-extracting.
2. Scalability: Leverages the processing power of modern cloud data warehouses.
3. Faster initial loading: No transformation bottleneck before loading.
4. Easier debugging: Raw data is available for troubleshooting.

Advantages of ETL:

1. Data privacy: Sensitive information can be filtered out before loading.
2. Reduced storage costs: Only relevant, transformed data is stored.
3. Better for complex transformations that are difficult to perform in SQL.
4. Potentially faster for small-scale operations or when source systems have limited bandwidth.

Current trends:

The industry is generally trending towards ELT for several reasons:

1. Cloud adoption: As more companies move to cloud-based data warehouses, ELT becomes more attractive due to the increased processing power available.
2. Big data: The volume and variety of data make it beneficial to load first and transform later.
3. Data lake architectures: These align well with the ELT approach, storing raw data for multiple use cases.
4. Agile analytics: ELT supports faster iteration on transformations and analytics.

However, ETL is still widely used and remains relevant, especially in scenarios involving:

1. On-premises data warehouses
2. Strict regulatory environments requiring data cleansing before storage
3. Legacy systems that are deeply integrated with ETL processes

It's worth noting that many modern data stacks use a hybrid approach, combining elements of both ETL and ELT as needed.

The trend in most companies, especially those adopting cloud technologies and dealing with big data, is moving towards ELT. However, the choice ultimately depends on specific business needs, existing infrastructure, and data governance requirements.
