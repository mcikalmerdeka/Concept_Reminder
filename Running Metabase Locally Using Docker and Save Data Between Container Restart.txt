Yes, Metabase has a free open source version that you can use for personal projects. Here's what you need to know:

The free self-hosted version (Metabase Open Source Edition) includes:
- Full core analytics and visualization features
- Ability to connect to most common databases
- Interactive dashboards and sharing capabilities
- SQL editor and visual query builder
- Unlimited users
- No time limitations

To use Metabase for free:
1. Download the open source version from the Metabase website or GitHub
2. Host it yourself on your own server or computer
3. Connect it to your database(s)

Popular hosting options for personal projects include:
- Running it on your local machine
- Using a small VPS like DigitalOcean, Linode, or AWS EC2
- Deploying to Heroku (though this is no longer free)

Keep in mind that while the software is free, you'll need to cover any hosting costs if you deploy it to a cloud provider. For personal projects, running it locally on your machine is often the simplest free option.

----------------------------------------------------------
i see that for free version to run locally you have this option of utilizing docker? can you explain how that works?


Yes, using Docker is one of the easiest ways to run Metabase locally. Docker creates a containerized environment that includes everything Metabase needs to run, making setup much simpler. Here's how it works:

1. First, you'll need to have Docker installed on your computer. You can download Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac from Docker's website.

2. Once Docker is installed, you can run Metabase with a single command:
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

This command:
- `-d` runs the container in detached mode (in the background)
- `-p 3000:3000` maps port 3000 on your computer to port 3000 in the container
- `--name metabase` gives your container a name
- `metabase/metabase` is the official Metabase Docker image

3. After running this command, Metabase will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser

To persist your Metabase data between container restarts, you can use a volume:
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

Some useful Docker commands for managing Metabase:
- Stop Metabase: `docker stop metabase`
- Start it again: `docker start metabase`
- View logs: `docker logs metabase`
- Remove container: `docker rm metabase`

------------------------------------------------------------

does my data like my visualizations, models, etc is saved everytime i start and stop my docker container? for example i make a visualization today and then tomorrow when i open it again with docker start metabase i will see my yesterday visualization?


It depends on how you set up your Docker container. By default, if you just use the basic command (`docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase`), your data will NOT persist between container restarts. This is because Docker containers are stateless by default.

To persist your data (visualizations, models, settings, etc.), you need to use Docker volumes. Here's the proper way to set it up with data persistence:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

This setup:
1. Creates a volume (`-v ~/metabase-data:/metabase-data`) that maps a folder on your computer to store Metabase's data
2. Tells Metabase where to store its database (`MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db`)

With this configuration:
- All your visualizations will be saved
- Your database connections will persist
- Your user settings will be maintained
- Your dashboards and collections will be preserved
- When you stop and start the container, everything will be exactly as you left it

If you're already running Metabase without volumes, you'll need to:
1. Stop the current container: `docker stop metabase`
2. Remove it: `docker rm metabase`
3. Run the new command with the volume configuration above

------------------------------------------------------------
so everytime i start docker i need to use that command?


No, you only need to use the full `docker run` command ONCE - the very first time you set up Metabase. After that, you can simply use:

```bash
docker start metabase
```

to start it, and:
```bash
docker stop metabase
```

to stop it.

This is because the `docker run` command creates the container with all its configurations (including the volume settings for data persistence). Once created, these settings are saved and will be used every time you start the container.

So your workflow would be:

1. First time setup (run once only):
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

2. For all future uses:
- To start: `docker start metabase`
- To stop: `docker stop metabase`
- To check if it's running: `docker ps`

The only time you'd need to run the full command again is if you delete the container (`docker rm metabase`) or want to create a new container with different settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i ran into a new problem that is whenever i shutdown my pc, and then i run docker start again, it actually start from the beginning again like setup and so-on and the data actually not saved? how can i fix this, i already use

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase

as the start in making the container

This sounds like Docker might not be preserving your container's state between system reboots. Here are a few troubleshooting steps:

1. First, check if your container exists:
```bash
docker ps -a
```
If it's not showing up, the container might have been removed during shutdown.

2. If the container is gone, modify your run command to add the `--restart` flag:
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase
```
The `--restart unless-stopped` ensures the container restarts automatically after system reboot.

3. Verify your volume is correctly mounted:
```bash
docker volume ls
```
Look for a volume related to your Metabase data.

4. If you're still having issues, try:
```bash
# Remove existing container
docker stop metabase
docker rm metabase

# Recreate with full persistent configuration
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

Note the slight change to the volume mount (using a named volume instead of a path).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is the output of docker volume ls, i didn't see the volume of metabase, why is that?

I see, the output of `docker volume ls` does not show a volume named specifically for Metabase. This could be the reason why your data is not persisting between reboots.

There are a couple of things to check:

1. **Verify the volume mount**: In your original `docker run` command, you used a host path (`~/metabase-data`) to mount the volume. This means the volume is tied to that specific path on your local machine. If that path doesn't exist or is not accessible, Docker will not be able to mount the volume correctly.

2. **Try using a named volume**: Instead of using a host path, you can create a named Docker volume and use that. This makes the volume more portable and less dependent on the specific file system path. Try modifying your command:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

The key difference is using `metabase-data:/metabase-data` instead of the host path. This will create a named volume called `metabase-data` and mount it to the container.

3. **Check the volume status**: After running the modified command, try running `docker volume ls` again. You should see the `metabase-data` volume listed.

4. **Verify data persistence**: Stop and start the Metabase container again, and check if your data (visualizations, models, etc.) are still there.

Let me know if you have any other questions! Troubleshooting volume mounts can sometimes be tricky, but using named volumes is generally the more reliable approach.

Important : comparison on the volume 

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v ~/metabase-data:/metabase-data -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" --restart unless-stopped --name metabase metabase/metabase

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v metabase-data:/metabase-data -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" --restart unless-stopped --name metabase metabase/metabase
