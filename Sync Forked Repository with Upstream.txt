When you fork a GitHub repository, you create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account, effectively taking a snapshot of its state at the time you forked it. This fork is independent of the original repository, but you can still fetch updates from the original repository (called the **upstream repository**) by following these steps:

### 1. Add the Original Repository as an Upstream Remote
First, add the original repository as a remote in your local clone of the fork:

```bash
git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>
```

Replace `<original-repo-url>` with the URL of the original repository. For example:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-creator/original-repo.git
```

You can verify the remotes with:

```bash
git remote -v
```

### 2. Fetch Updates from the Original Repository
Fetch the updates from the original repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

This will fetch the latest changes from the original repository without modifying your working files. 

### 3. Merge Updates into Your Fork's Branch
To integrate the updates into your fork, switch to your branch (usually `main`) and merge the changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

This applies the changes from the original repository to your fork's local branch. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.

### 4. Push the Updates to Your Fork
Finally, push the updated branch to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 5. Optional: Keep Fork in Sync
Repeat these steps periodically to keep your fork updated with the original repository.

If your fork is very out of sync, consider rebasing instead of merging:

```bash
git rebase upstream/main
```

This rewrites your commits on top of the latest commits from the upstream repository, keeping a cleaner history.

let's say this is the repository that i want to fork

https://github.com/landing-ai/vision-agent.git

If you want to fork the repository `https://github.com/landing-ai/vision-agent.git` and keep it updated with changes from the original repository, here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Fork the Repository**
1. Go to the [vision-agent repository on GitHub](https://github.com/landing-ai/vision-agent.git).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page.
3. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/vision-agent.git`).

---

### **2. Clone Your Fork Locally**
1. Copy the URL of your forked repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/vision-agent.git`).
2. Open a terminal and clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vision-agent.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd vision-agent
   ```

---

### **3. Add the Original Repository as an Upstream Remote**
To fetch updates from the original repository, add it as an upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/landing-ai/vision-agent.git
```

You can verify this setup using:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see two remotes:  
- `origin` pointing to your fork (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/vision-agent.git`)  
- `upstream` pointing to the original repository (`https://github.com/landing-ai/vision-agent.git`).

---

### **4. Fetch Updates from the Original Repository**
To get updates from the original repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

This fetches changes from the original repository without modifying your current files.

---

### **5. Merge Updates into Your Local Branch**
Switch to your main branch and merge updates from the upstream:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise. This step ensures your local branch has the latest changes from the original repository.

---

### **6. Push Changes to Your Fork**
To update your GitHub fork with the new changes:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

### **7. Keep Fork in Sync (Repeat Regularly)**
Whenever the original repository gets updated, repeat **Steps 4 to 6** to keep your fork up to date.

---

### **Note** 
If the repository uses additional branches (e.g., `dev`), youâ€™ll need to repeat these steps for each branch you want to keep updated:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout dev
git merge upstream/dev
git push origin dev
``` 

This process ensures your fork remains in sync with the original repository.

can you explain what the fetch command do here?

The `git fetch` command is used to **retrieve updates from a remote repository** without applying any changes to your working directory or local branches. Here's what it does in the context of syncing a fork:

### **When You Run: `git fetch upstream`**
1. **Connect to the Remote Repository (`upstream`)**  
   Git connects to the specified remote repository (in this case, the original repository you added as `upstream`) to check for any changes.

2. **Download Updates**  
   Git downloads the latest changes from the remote repository into your local repository's hidden storage area (the `.git` directory). These changes include:
   - New commits.
   - New branches.
   - Updated tags.

3. **No Changes to Your Working Directory or Local Branches**  
   The `fetch` command only updates your local knowledge of the remote repository. It does **not** modify your working files or branches. Instead, it creates or updates remote tracking branches like `upstream/main`.

### **Key Outcomes of `git fetch upstream`**
- Git updates your knowledge of the upstream repository. For example:
  - If the upstream repository's `main` branch has new commits, Git creates or updates a branch called `upstream/main` in your local repository.
  - It doesn't touch your `main` branch yet.
- You can inspect the fetched updates without applying them:
  ```bash
  git log upstream/main
  ```

### **How It Fits into Fork Updates**
- After fetching updates from `upstream`, the changes are stored in `upstream/main` (or other branches as needed).
- To apply those updates to your fork's `main` branch, you merge or rebase your `main` branch with `upstream/main`.

### **Comparison with Other Commands**
- **`git pull`:** Combines `fetch` and `merge` (or rebase) into one command, immediately applying the fetched updates to your current branch. This isn't used for syncing forks because you'd be pulling from your fork (`origin`) by default, not the original repository (`upstream`).
- **`git fetch`:** Only retrieves updates, giving you control over when and how to integrate them into your branch.

By separating fetching and merging, you avoid unintended changes to your branch and gain flexibility in managing updates.
