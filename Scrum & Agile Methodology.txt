Agile is a flexible, iterative approach to project management and software development that emphasizes:
1. Breaking work into small chunks 
2. Frequent delivery and feedback
3. Adapting to changes quickly
4. Collaboration between teams

Scrum is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing Agile. Think of it this way: Agile is like a mindset or philosophy, while Scrum is a specific way to put that philosophy into practice. Here's a practical example of how Agile/Scrum works in a data science project:

Traditional (Non-Agile) Approach:
6-month project plan:
Month 1-2: Gather ALL requirements
Month 2-3: Clean ALL data
Month 3-4: Build COMPLETE model
Month 4-5: Test EVERYTHING
Month 5-6: Deploy FINAL version

Agile/Scrum Approach:
2-week sprints:
Sprint 1: 
- Build basic model with just 2 key features
- Test and deploy this simple version
- Get feedback from users


Sprint 2:
- Add 3 more features based on feedback
- Improve model accuracy
- Deploy updated version

Sprint 3:
- Add visualization dashboard
- Fix bugs reported by users
- Deploy new features

Common Scrum elements you'll see in data jobs:
1. Daily Standup: 15-minute team meeting to discuss progress
2. Sprint Planning: Team decides what to accomplish in next 2 weeks
3. Sprint Review: Demo completed work to stakeholders
4. Sprint Retrospective: Team discusses what went well/poorly

In data science roles, you might hear things like:
- "We're using Agile methodologies to iterate on our recommendation algorithm"
- "Join our daily Scrum to update on your feature engineering progress"
- "Let's add this new data pipeline to next sprint's backlog"

The reason many data jobs require Agile/Scrum knowledge is that it helps teams:
- Deliver value faster through incremental improvements
- Adapt to changing requirements or new data
- Maintain clear communication between data scientists, engineers, and stakeholders
- Track progress effectively
